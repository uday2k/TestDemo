=== Splitter

[[splitter-annotation]]
==== Introduction

The Splitter is a component whose role is to partition a message in several parts, and send the resulting messages to be processed independently.
Very often, they are upstream producers in a pipeline that includes an Aggregator.

==== Programming model

The API for performing splitting consists of one base class, `AbstractMessageSplitter`, which is a `MessageHandler` implementation, encapsulating features which are common to splitters, such as filling in the appropriate message headers CORRELATION_ID, SEQUENCE_SIZE, and SEQUENCE_NUMBER on the messages that are produced.
This enables tracking down the messages and the results of their processing (in a typical scenario, these headers would be copied over to the messages that are produced by the various transforming endpoints), and use them, for example, in ahttp://www.eaipatterns.com/DistributionAggregate.html[Composed Message Processor] scenario.

An excerpt from `AbstractMessageSplitter` can be seen below:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractMessageSplitter
    extends AbstractReplyProducingMessageConsumer {
    ...
    protected abstract Object splitMessage(Message<?> message);

}
----

To implement a specific Splitter in an application, extend `AbstractMessageSplitter` and implement the `splitMessage` method, which contains logic for splitting the messages.
The return value may be one of the following:

* A `Collection` or an array of Messages, or an `Iterable` (or `Iterator`) that iterates over Messages - in this case the messages will be sent as such (after the CORRELATION_ID, SEQUENCE_SIZE and SEQUENCE_NUMBER are populated).
Using this approach gives more control to the developer, for example for populating custom message headers as part of the splitting process.

* A `Collection` or an array of non-Message objects, or an `Iterable` (or `Iterator`) that iterates over non-Message objects - works like the prior case, except that each collection element will be used as a Message payload.
Using this approach allows developers to focus on the domain objects without having to consider the Messaging system and produces code that is easier to test.

* a `Message` or non-Message object (but not a Collection or an Array) - it works like the previous cases, except a single message will be sent out.



In Spring Integration, any POJO can implement the splitting algorithm, provided that it defines a method that accepts a single argument and has a return value.
In this case, the return value of the method will be interpreted as described above.
The input argument might either be a `Message` or a simple POJO.
In the latter case, the splitter will receive the payload of the incoming message.
Since this decouples the code from the Spring Integration API and will typically be easier to test, it is the recommended approach.

*Splitter and Iterators*

Starting with _version 4.1_, the `AbstractMessageSplitter` supports the `Iterator` type for the `value` to split.
Note, in the case of an `Iterator` (or `Iterable`), we don't have access to the number of underlying items and the `SEQUENCE_SIZE` header is set to `0`.
This means that the default `SequenceSizeReleaseStrategy` of an `<aggregator>` won't work and the group for the `CORRELATION_ID` from the `splitter` won't be released; it will remain as `incomplete`.
In this case you should use an appropriate custom `ReleaseStrategy` or rely on `send-partial-result-on-expiry` together with `group-timeout` or a `MessageGroupStoreReaper`.

An `Iterator` object is useful to avoid the need for building an entire collection in the memory before splitting.
For example, when underlying items are populated from some external system (e.g.
DataBase or FTP `MGET`) using iterations or streams.

==== Configuring Splitter

===== Configuring a Splitter using XML

A splitter can be configured through XML as follows:
[source,xml]
----
<int:channel id="inputChannel"/>

<int:splitter id="splitter"  <1>
  ref="splitterBean"  <2>
  method="split"  <3>
  input-channel="inputChannel"  <4>
  output-channel="outputChannel" /> <5>

<int:channel id="outputChannel"/>

<beans:bean id="splitterBean" class="sample.PojoSplitter"/>
----



<1> The id of the splitter is _optional_.



<2> A reference to a bean defined in the application context.
The bean must implement the splitting logic as described in the section above ._Optional_.
If reference to a bean is not provided, then it is assumed that the _payload_ of the Message that arrived on the `input-channel` is an implementation of `java.util.Collection` and the default splitting logic will be applied to the Collection, incorporating each individual element into a Message and sending it to the `output-channel`.



<3> The method (defined on the bean specified above) that implements the splitting logic._Optional_.



<4> The input channel of the splitter.
_Required_.



<5> The channel to which the splitter will send the results of splitting the incoming message.
_Optional (because incoming
          messages can specify a reply channel themselves)_.

Using a `ref` attribute is generally recommended if the custom splitter implementation may be referenced in other `<splitter>` definitions.
However if the custom splitter handler implementation should be scoped to a single definition of the `<splitter>`, configure an inner bean definition:
[source,xml]
----
<int:splitter id="testSplitter" input-channel="inChannel" method="split"
                output-channel="outChannel">
  <beans:bean class="org.foo.TestSplitter"/>
</int:spliter>
----

NOTE: Using both a `ref` attribute and an inner handler definition in the same `<int:splitter>` configuration is not allowed, as it creates an ambiguous condition and will result in an Exception being thrown.

===== Configuring a Splitter with Annotations

The `@Splitter` annotation is applicable to methods that expect either the`Message` type or the message payload type, and the return values of the method should be a `Collection` of any type.
If the returned values are not actual `Message` objects, then each item will be wrapped in a Message as its payload.
Each message will be sent to the designated output channel for the endpoint on which the `@Splitter` is defined.
[source,java]
----
@Splitter
List<LineItem> extractItems(Order order) {
    return order.getItems()
}

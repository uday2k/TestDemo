=== Scatter-Gather

[[scatter-gather-introduction]]
==== Introduction

Starting with _version 4.1_, Spring Integration provides an implementation of the http://www.eaipatterns.com/BroadcastAggregate.html[Scatter-Gather] Enterprise Integration Pattern.
It is a compound endpoint, where the goal is to send a message to the recipients and aggregate the results.
Quoting the EIP Book, it is a component for scenarios like_best quote_, when we need to request information from several suppliers and decide which one provides us with the best term for the requested item.

Previously, the pattern could be configured using discrete components, this enhancement brings more convenient configuration.

The `ScatterGatherHandler` is a _request-reply_ endpoint that combines a`PublishSubscribeChannel` (or `RecipientListRouter`) and an `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
The request message is sent to the `scatter` channel and the `ScatterGatherHandler` waits for the reply from the aggregator to sends to the `outputChannel`.

[[scatter-gather-functionality]]
==== Functionality

The `Scatter-Gather` pattern suggests two scenarios - _Auction_ and _Distribution_.
In both cases, the `aggregation` function is the same and provides all options available for the `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
Actually the `ScatterGatherHandler` just requires an `AggregatingMessageHandler` as a constructor argument.
See <<aggregator>> for more information.

_Auction_

The _Auction_`Scatter-Gather` variant uses `publish-subscribe` logic for the request message, where the `scatter` channel is a `PublishSubscribeChannel` with `apply-sequence="true"`.
However, this channel can be any `MessageChannel` implementation as is the case with the `request-channel` in the `ContentEnricher` (see <<content-enricher>>) but, in this case, the end-user should support his own custom `correlationStrategy` for the `aggregation` function.

_Distribution_

The _Distribution_`Scatter-Gather` variant is based on the `RecipientListRouter` (see <<router-implementations-recipientlistrouter>>) with all available options for the `RecipientListRouter`.
This is the second `ScatterGatherHandler` constructor argument.
If you want to rely just on the default `correlationStrategy` for the `recipient-list-router` and the `aggregator`, you should specify `apply-sequence="true"`.
Otherwise, a custom `correlationStrategy` should be supplied for the `aggregator`.
Unlike the `PublishSubscribeChannel` (_Auction_) variant, having a `recipient-list-router` `selector` option, we can _filter_ target suppliers based on the message.
With `apply-sequence="true"` the default `sequenceSize` will be supplied and the `aggregator` will be able to release the group correctly.
The _Distribution_ option is mutually exclusive with the _Auction_ option.

In both cases, the request (_scatter_) message is enriched with the `gatherResultChannel` `QueueChannel` header, to wait for a reply message from the `aggregator`.

By default, all suppliers should send their result to the `replyChannel` header (usually by omitting the `output-channel` from the ultimate endpoint).
However, the `gatherChannel` option is also provided, allowing suppliers to send their reply to that channel for the aggregation.

==== Configuring a Scatter-Gather Endpoint

For Java and Annotation configuration, the bean definition for the `Scatter-Gather` is:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageHandler distributor() {
	RecipientListRouter router = new RecipientListRouter();
	router.setApplySequence(true);
	router.setChannels(Arrays.asList(distributionChannel1(), distributionChannel2(),
	        distributionChannel3()));
	return router;
}

@Bean
public MessageHandler gatherer() {
	return new AggregatingMessageHandler(
			new ExpressionEvaluatingMessageGroupProcessor("^[payload gt 5] ?: -1D"),
			new SimpleMessageStore(),
			new HeaderAttributeCorrelationStrategy(
			       IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.CORRELATION_ID),
			new ExpressionEvaluatingReleaseStrategy("size() == 2"));
}

@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "distributionChannel")
public MessageHandler scatterGatherDistribution() {
	ScatterGatherHandler handler = new ScatterGatherHandler(distributor(), gatherer());
	handler.setOutputChannel(output());
	return handler;
}
----

Here, we configure the `RecipientListRouter` `distributor` bean, with `applySequence="true"` and the list of recipient channels.
The next bean is for an `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
Finally, we inject both those beans into the `ScatterGatherHandler` bean definition and mark it as a `@ServiceActivator` to wire the Scatter-Gather component into the integration flow.

Configuring the `<scatter-gather>` endpoint using the XML namespace:

[source,xml]
----
<scatter-gather
		id=""  <1>
		auto-startup=""  <2>
		input-channel=""  <3>
		output-channel=""  <4>
		scatter-channel=""  <5>
		gather-channel=""  <6>
		order=""  <7>
		phase=""  <8>
		send-timeout=""  <9>
		gather-timeout=""  <10>
		requires-reply="" > <11>
			<scatterer/>  <12>
			<gatherer/>  <13>
</scatter-gather>
----

<1> The id of the Endpoint.
The `ScatterGatherHandler` bean is registered with `id + '.handler'` alias.
The `RecipientListRouter` - with `id + '.scatterer'`.
And the `AggregatingMessageHandler` with `id + '.gatherer'`.
_Optional_ (a default id is generated value by `BeanFactory`).



<2> Lifecycle attribute signaling if the Endpoint should be started during Application Context initialization.
In addition, the `ScatterGatherHandler` also implements `Lifecycle` and starts/stops the `gatherEndpoint`, which is created internally if a `gather-channel` is provided.
_Optional_ (default is `true`).



<3> The channel to receive request messages to handle them in the `ScatterGatherHandler`.
_Required_.



<4> The channel to which the Scatter-Gather will send the aggregation results.
_Optional (because incoming messages can specify a
						reply channel themselves via `replyChannel` Message Header)_.



<5> The channel to send the scatter message for the _Auction_ scenario.
_Optional_.
Mutually exclusive with `<scatterer>` sub -element.



<6> The channel to receive replies from each supplier for the aggregation.
is used as the `replyChannel` header in the scatter message.
_Optional_.
By default the `FixedSubscriberChannel` is created.



<7> Order of this component when more than one handler is subscribed to the same DirectChannel (use for load balancing purposes)._Optional_.



<8> Specify the phase in which the endpoint should be started and stopped.
The startup order proceeds from lowest to highest, and the shutdown order is the reverse of that.
By default this value is Integer.MAX_VALUE meaning that this container starts as late as possible and stops as soon as possible._Optional_.



<9> The timeout interval to wait when sending a reply `Message` to the `output-channel`.
By default the send will block for one second.
It applies only if the output channel has some 'sending' limitations, e.g.
a `QueueChannel` with a fixed 'capacity' and is full.
In this case, a `MessageDeliveryException` is thrown.
The `send-timeout` is ignored in case of `AbstractSubscribableChannel` implementations.
In case of `group-timeout(-expression)` the `MessageDeliveryException` from the scheduled expire task leads this task to be rescheduled.
_Optional_.



<10> Allows you to specify how long the Scatter-Gather will wait for the reply message before returning.
By default it will wait indefinitely.
'null' is returned if the reply times out.
_Optional_.
Defaults to `-1` - indefinitely.



<11> Specify whether the Scatter-Gather must return a non-null value.
This value is `true` by default, hence a `ReplyRequiredException` will be thrown when the underlying aggregator returns a null value after `gather-timeout`.
Note, if `null` is a possibility, the `gather-timeout` should be specified to avoid an indefinite wait.



<12> The `<recipient-list-router>` options.
_Optional_.
Mutually exclusive with `scatter-channel` attribute.



<13> The `<aggregator>` options.
_Required_.

== Endpoint Quick Reference Table

As discussed in the sections above, Spring Integration provides a number of endpoints used to interface with external systems, file systems etc.
The following is a summary of the various endpoints with quick links to the appropriate chapter.

To recap, *Inbound Channel Adapters* are used for one-way integration bringing data into the messaging application.
*Outbound Channel Adapters* are used for one-way integration to send data out of the messaging application.
*Inbound Gateways* are used for a bidirectional integration flow where some other system invokes the messaging application and receives a reply.*Outbound Gateways* are used for a bidirectional integration flow where the messaging application invokes some external service or entity, expecting a result.

|===

In addition, as discussed in <<spring-integration-core-messaging>>, endpoints are provided for interfacing with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
As discussed in <<channel-adapter>>, the `<int:inbound-channel-adapter>` allows polling a java method for data; the `<int:outbound-channel-adapter>` allows sending data to a `void` method, and as discussed in <<gateway>>, the `<int:gateway>` allows any Java program to invoke a messaging flow.
Each of these without requiring any source level dependencies on Spring Integration.
The equivalent of an outbound gateway in this context would be to use a <<service-activator>> to invoke a method that returns an Object of some kind.

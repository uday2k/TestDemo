=== Codec

==== Introduction

Spring Integration _version 4.2_ introduces the `Codec` abstraction.
Codecs are used to encode/decode objects to/from `byte[]`.
They are an alternative to Java Serialization.
One advantage is, typically, objects do not have to implement `Serializable`.
One implementation, using https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo[Kryo] for serialization, is provided but you
can provide your own implementation for use in any of these components:

* `EncodingPayloadTransformer`
* `DecodingTransformer`
* `CodecMessageConverter`

See their JavaDocs for more information.

==== EncodingPayloadTransformer

This transformer encodes the payload to a `byte[]` using the codec.
It does not affect message headers.

==== DecodingTransformer

This transformer decodes a `byte[]` using the codec; it needs to be configured with the Class to which the object
should be decoded (or an expression that resolves to a Class).
If the resulting object is a `Message<?>`, inbound headers will not be retained.

==== CodecMessageConverter

Certain endpoints (e.g. TCP, Redis) have no concept of message headers; they support the use of a
`MessageConverter` and the `CodecMessageConverter` can be used to convert a message to/from a `byte[]` for
transmission.

==== Kryo

Currently, this is the only implementation of `Codec`.
There are two `Codec` s - `PojoCodec` which can be used in the transformers and `MessageCodec` which can be used
in the `CodecMessageConverter`.

Several custom serializers are provided by the framework:

* `FileSerializer`
* `MessageHeadersSerializer`
* `MutableMessageHeadersSerializer`

The first can be used with the `PojoCodec`, by initializing it with the `FileKryoRegistrar`.
The second and third are used with the `MessageCodec`, which is initialized with the `MessageKryoRegistrar`.

===== Customizing Kryo

By default, Kryo delegates unknown Java types to its `FieldSerializer`.
Kryo also registers default serializers for each primitive type along with `String`, `Collection` and `Map` serializers.
`FieldSerializer` uses reflection to navigate the object graph. A more efficient approach is to implement a custom
serializer that is aware of the object's structure and can directly serialize selected primitive fields:

[source,java]
----
public class AddressSerializer extends Serializer<Address> {
	@Override
	public void write(Kryo kryo, Output output, Address address) {
		output.writeString(address.getStreet());
		output.writeString(address.getCity());
		output.writeString(address.getCountry());
	}

	@Override
	public Address read(Kryo kryo, Input input, Class<Address> type) {
		return new Address(input.readString(),input.readString(),input.readString());
	}
}
----

The `Serializer` interface exposes `Kryo`, `Input`, and `Output` which provide
complete control over which fields are included and other internal settings as
described in the https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo[documentation].

NOTE: When registering your custom serializer, you need a registration ID.
The registration IDs are arbitrary but in our case must be explicitly defined because each Kryo instance across the
distributed application must use the same IDs.
Kryo recommends small positive integers, and reserves a few ids (value < 10).
Spring Integration currently defaults to using 40, 41 and 42 (for the file and message header serializers mentioned
above); we recommend you start at, say 60, to allow for expansion in the framework.
These framework defaults can be overridden by configuring the registrars mentioned above.

====== Using a Custom Kryo Serializer

If custom serialization is indicated, please consult the https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo[Kryo] documentation
since you will be using the native API.
For an example, see the `MessageCodec`.

====== Implementing KryoSerializable

If you have write access to the domain object source code it may implement `KryoSerializable` as described
https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo#kryoserializable[here].
In this case
the class provides the serialization methods itself and no further configuration
is required. This has the advantage of being much simpler to use
with XD, however benchmarks have shown this is not quite as efficient as
registering a custom serializer explicitly:

[source,java]
----
public class Address implements KryoSerializable {
	...

	@Override
	public void write(Kryo kryo, Output output) {
		output.writeString(this.street);
		output.writeString(this.city);
		output.writeString(this.country);
	}

	@Override
	public void read(Kryo kryo, Input input) {
		this.street = input.readString();
		this.city = input.readString();
		this.country = input.readString();
	}
}
----

Note that this technique can also be used to wrap a serialization library other than Kryo.

====== Using DefaultSerializer Annotation

Kryo also provides an annotation as described https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo#default-serializers[here].

[source,java]
----
@DefaultSerializer(SomeClassSerializer.class)
public class SomeClass {
       // ...
}
----

If you have write access to the domain object this may be a simpler alternative to specify a custom serializer.
Note this does not register the class with an ID, so your mileage may vary.

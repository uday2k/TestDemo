== HTTP Support

[[http-intro]]
=== Introduction

The HTTP support allows for the execution of HTTP requests and the processing of inbound HTTP requests.
Because interaction over HTTP is always synchronous, even if all that is returned is a 200 status code, the HTTP support consists of two gateway implementations: `HttpInboundEndpoint` and `HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler`.

[[http-inbound]]
=== Http Inbound Gateway

To receive messages over HTTP, you need to use an _HTTP Inbound
		Channel Adapter_ or _Gateway_.
To support the _HTTP Inbound Adapters_, they need to be deployed within a servlet container such as http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty].
The easiest way to do this is to use Spring's http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/HttpRequestHandlerServlet.html[HttpRequestHandlerServlet], by providing the following servlet definition in the _web.xml_ file:

[source,xml]
----
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>inboundGateway</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>o.s.web.context.support.HttpRequestHandlerServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
----

Notice that the servlet name matches the bean name.
For more information on using the `HttpRequestHandlerServlet`, see chapter "http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/remoting.html[Remoting and web services using Spring]", which is part of the Spring Framework Reference documentation.

If you are running within a Spring MVC application, then the aforementioned explicit servlet definition is not necessary.
In that case, the bean name for your gateway can be matched against the URL path just like a Spring MVC Controller bean.
For more information, please see the chapter "http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html[Web MVC framework]", which is part of the Spring Framework Reference documentation.

TIP: For a sample application and the corresponding configuration, please see the https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples[Spring Integration Samples] repository.
It contains the https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples/tree/master/basic/http[Http Sample] application demonstrating Spring Integration's HTTP support.

Below is an example bean definition for a simple HTTP inbound endpoint.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="httpInbound"
  class="org.springframework.integration.http.inbound.HttpRequestHandlingMessagingGateway">
  <property name="requestChannel" ref="httpRequestChannel" />
  <property name="replyChannel" ref="httpReplyChannel" />
</bean>
----

The `HttpRequestHandlingMessagingGateway` accepts a list of `HttpMessageConverter` instances or else relies on a default list.
The converters allow customization of the mapping from `HttpServletRequest` to `Message`.
The default converters encapsulate simple strategies, which for example will create a String message for a _POST_ request where the content type starts with "text", see the Javadoc for full details.
An additional flag (`mergeWithDefaultConverters`) can be set along with the list of custom `HttpMessageConverter` to add the default converters after the custom converters.
By default this flag is set to false, meaning that the custom converters replace the default list.

Starting with _Spring Integration 2.0_, MultiPart File support is implemented.
If the request has been wrapped as a _MultipartHttpServletRequest_, when using the default converters, that request will be converted to a Message payload that is a MultiValueMap containing values that may be byte arrays, Strings, or instances of Spring's `MultipartFile` depending on the content type of the individual parts.

NOTE: The HTTP inbound Endpoint will locate a MultipartResolver in the context if one exists with the bean name "multipartResolver" (the same name expected by Spring's DispatcherServlet).
If it does in fact locate that bean, then the support for MultipartFiles will be enabled on the inbound request mapper.
Otherwise, it will fail when trying to map a multipart-file request to a Spring Integration Message.
For more on Spring's support for MultipartResolvers, refer to the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-multipart[Spring Reference Manual].

[NOTE]
====
If you wish to proxy a `multipart/form-data` to another server, it may be better to keep it in raw form.
To handle this situation, do not add the `multipartResolver` bean to the context; configure the endpoint to expect
a `byte[]` request; customize the message converters to include a `ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter`, and
disable the default multipart converter.
You may need some other converter(s) for the replies:

[source, xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-gateway
                  channel="receiveChannel"
                  path="/inboundAdapter.htm"
                  request-payload-type="byte[]"
                  message-converters="converters"
                  merge-with-default-converters="false"
                  supported-methods="POST" />

<util:list id="converters">
    <beans:bean class="org.springframework.http.converter.ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter" />
    <beans:bean class="org.springframework.http.converter.StringHttpMessageConverter" />
    <beans:bean class="org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter" />
</util:list>
----
====

In sending a response to the client there are a number of ways to customize the behavior of the gateway.
By default the gateway will simply acknowledge that the request was received by sending a 200 status code back.
It is possible to customize this response by providing a 'viewName' to be resolved by the Spring MVC `ViewResolver`.
In the case that the gateway should expect a reply to the `Message` then setting the `expectReply` flag (constructor argument) will cause the gateway to wait for a reply `Message` before creating an HTTP response.
Below is an example of a gateway configured to serve as a Spring MVC Controller with a view name.
Because of the constructor arg value of TRUE, it wait for a reply.
This also shows how to customize the HTTP methods accepted by the gateway, which are _POST_ and _GET_ by default.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="httpInbound"
  class="org.springframework.integration.http.inbound.HttpRequestHandlingController">
  <constructor-arg value="true" /> <!-- indicates that a reply is expected -->
  <property name="requestChannel" ref="httpRequestChannel" />
  <property name="replyChannel" ref="httpReplyChannel" />
  <property name="viewName" value="jsonView" />
  <property name="supportedMethodNames" >
    <list>
      <value>GET</value>
      <value>DELETE</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

The reply message will be available in the Model map.
The key that is used for that map entry by default is 'reply', but this can be overridden by setting the 'replyKey' property on the endpoint's configuration.

[[http-outbound]]
=== Http Outbound Gateway

To configure the `HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler` write a bean definition like this:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="httpOutbound"
  class="org.springframework.integration.http.outbound.HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler">
  <constructor-arg value="http://localhost:8080/example" />
  <property name="outputChannel" ref="responseChannel" />
</bean>
----

This bean definition will execute HTTP requests by delegating to a `RestTemplate`.
That template in turn delegates to a list of HttpMessageConverters to generate the HTTP request body from the Message payload.
You can configure those converters as well as the ClientHttpRequestFactory instance to use:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="httpOutbound"
  class="org.springframework.integration.http.outbound.HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler">
  <constructor-arg value="http://localhost:8080/example" />
  <property name="outputChannel" ref="responseChannel" />
  <property name="messageConverters" ref="messageConverterList" />
  <property name="requestFactory" ref="customRequestFactory" />
</bean>
----

By default the HTTP request will be generated using an instance of `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` which uses the JDK `HttpURLConnection`.
Use of the Apache Commons HTTP Client is also supported through the provided `CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory` which can be injected as shown above.

NOTE: In the case of the Outbound Gateway, the reply message produced by the gateway will contain all Message Headers present in the request message.

_Cookies_

Basic cookie support is provided by the _transfer-cookies_ attribute on the outbound gateway.
When set to true (default is false), a _Set-Cookie_ header received from the server in a response will be converted to _Cookie_ in the reply message.
This header will then be used on subsequent sends.
This enables simple stateful interactions, such as...

`...->logonGateway->...->doWorkGateway->...->logoffGateway->...`

If _transfer-cookies_ is false, any _Set-Cookie_ header received will remain as _Set-Cookie_ in the reply message, and will be dropped on subsequent sends.

[NOTE]
.Note: Empty Repsonse Bodies
=====
HTTP is a request/response protocol.
However the response may not have a body, just headers.
In this case, the `HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler` produces a reply `Message` with the payload being an `org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity`, regardless of any provided `expected-response-type`.
According to the http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[HTTP RFC Status Code Definitions], there are many statuses which identify that a response MUST NOT contain a message-body (e.g.
204 No Content).
There are also cases where calls to the same URL might, or might not, return a response body; for example, the first request to an HTTP resource returns content, but the second does not (e.g.
304 Not Modified).
In all cases, however, the `http_statusCode` message header is populated.
This can be used in some routing logic after the Http Outbound Gateway.
You could also use a`<payload-type-router/>` to route messages with an `ResponseEntity` to a different flow than that used for responses with a body.
=====
[NOTE]
.Note: expected-response-type
=====
Further to the note above regarding *empty response bodies*, if a response *does* contain a body, you must provide an appropriate `expected-response-type` attribute or, again, you will simply receive a `ResponseEntity` with no body.
The `expected-response-type` must be compatible with the (configured or default) `HttpMessageConverter` s and the `Content-Type` header in the response.
Of course, this can be an abstract class, or even an interface (such as `java.io.Serializable` when using java serialization and `Content-Type: application/x-java-serialized-object`).
=====

[[http-namespace]]
=== HTTP Namespace Support

==== Introduction

Spring Integration provides an _http_ namespace and the corresponding schema definition.
To include it in your configuration, simply provide the following namespace declaration in your application context configuration file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration"
  xmlns:int-http="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/http"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/spring-integration.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/http
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/http/spring-integration-http.xsd">
    ...
</beans>
----

==== Inbound

The XML Namespace provides two components for handling HTTP Inbound requests.
In order to process requests without returning a dedicated response, use the _inbound-channel-adapter_:

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-channel-adapter id="httpChannelAdapter" channel="requests"
    supported-methods="PUT, DELETE"/>
----

To process requests that do expect a response, use an _inbound-gateway_:

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-gateway id="inboundGateway"
    request-channel="requests"
    reply-channel="responses"/>
----

==== Request Mapping Support

NOTE: _Spring Integration 3.0_ is improving the REST support by introducing the http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/http/inbound/IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping.html[IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping].
The implementation relies on the enhanced REST support provided by Spring Framework 3.1 or higher.

The parsing of the _HTTP Inbound Gateway_ or the _HTTP Inbound Channel Adapter_ registers an `integrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping` bean of type http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/http/inbound/IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping.html[IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping], in case there is none registered, yet.
This particular implementation of the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerMapping.html[`HandlerMapping`] delegates its logic to the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/RequestMappingInfoHandlerMapping.html[`RequestMappingInfoHandlerMapping`].
The implementation provides similar functionality as the one provided by the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html[`org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping`] annotation in Spring MVC.

NOTE: For more information, please see http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping[Mapping Requests With @RequestMapping].

For this purpose, _Spring Integration 3.0_ introduces the `<request-mapping>` sub-element.
This optional sub-element can be added to the `<http:inbound-channel-adapter>` and the `<http:inbound-gateway>`.
It works in conjunction with the `path` and `supported-methods` attributes:

[source,xml]
----
<inbound-gateway id="inboundController"
    request-channel="requests"
    reply-channel="responses"
    path="/foo/{fooId}"
    supported-methods="GET"
    view-name="foo"
    error-code="oops">
   <request-mapping headers="User-Agent"
     params="myParam=myValue"
     consumes="application/json"
     produces="!text/plain"/>
</inbound-gateway>
----

Based on this configuration, the namespace parser creates an instance of the `IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping` (if none exists, yet), a `HttpRequestHandlingController` bean and associated with it an instance of http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/http/inbound/RequestMapping.html[`RequestMapping`], which in turn, is converted to the Spring MVC http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/RequestMappingInfo.html[`RequestMappingInfo`].

The `<request-mapping>` sub-element provides the following attributes:

* headers
* params
* consumes
* produces



With the `path` and `supported-methods` attributes of the `<http:inbound-channel-adapter>` or the `<http:inbound-gateway>`, `<request-mapping>` attributes translate directly into the respective options provided by the `org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping` annotation in Spring MVC.

The `<request-mapping>` sub-element allows you to configure several _Spring Integration_ HTTP Inbound Endpoints to the same `path` (or even the same `supported-methods`) and to provide different downstream message flows based on incoming HTTP requests.

Alternatively, you can also declare just one HTTP Inbound Endpoint and apply routing and filtering logic within the _Spring Integration_ flow to achieve the same result.
This allows you to get the `Message` into the flow as early as possibly, e.g.:

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-gateway request-channel="httpMethodRouter"
    supported-methods="GET,DELETE"
    path="/process/{entId}"
    payload-expression="#pathVariables.entId"/>

<int:router input-channel="httpMethodRouter" expression="headers.http_requestMethod">
    <int:mapping value="GET" channel="in1"/>
    <int:mapping value="DELETE" channel="in2"/>
</int:router>

<int:service-activator input-channel="in1" ref="service" method="getEntity"/>

<int:service-activator input-channel="in2" ref="service" method="delete"/>
----

For more information regarding _Handler Mappings_, please see: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-handlermapping[Handler Mappings].

[[http-cors]]
==== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support

Starting with _version 4.2_ the `<http:inbound-channel-adapter>` and `<http:inbound-gateway>` can be configured with
a `<cross-origin>` sub-element.
It represents the same options as Spring MVC's `@CrossOrigin` for `@Controller` methods
and allows the configuration of Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for Spring Integration HTTP endpoints:

* `origin` - List of allowed origins.
`*` means that all origins are allowed.
These values are placed in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header of both the pre-flight
and actual responses.
Default value is `*`.

* `allowed-headers` - Indicates which request headers can be used during the actual request.
`*` means that all headers asked by the client are allowed.
This property controls the value of the pre-flight response's `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header.
Default value is `*`.

* `exposed-headers` - List of response headers that the user-agent will allow the client to access.
This property controls the value of the actual response's `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.

* `method` - The HTTP request methods to allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE.
Methods specified here overrides those in `supported-methods`.

* `allow-credentials` - Set to `true` if the the browser should include any cookies associated to the domain
of the request, or `false` if it should not.
Empty string "" means undefined.
If `true`, the pre-flight response will include the header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true`.
Default value is `true`.

* `max-age` - Controls the cache duration for pre-flight responses.
Setting this to a reasonable value can reduce the number of pre-flight request/response interactions required by
the browser.
This property controls the value of the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header in the pre-flight response.
A value of `-1` means undefined.
Default value is 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes.

The CORS Java Configuration is represented by the `org.springframework.integration.http.inbound.CrossOrigin` class,
instances of which can be injected to the `HttpRequestHandlingEndpointSupport` beans.

[[http-response-statuscode]]
==== Response StatusCode

Starting with _version 4.1_ the `<http:inbound-channel-adapter>` can be configured with a `status-code-expression` to override the default `200 OK` status.
The expression must return an object which can be converted to an `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus` enum value.
The `evaluationContext` has a `BeanResolver` but no variables, so the usage of this attribute is somewhat limited.
An example might be to resolve, at runtime, some scoped Bean that returns a status code value but, most likely, it will be set to a fixed value such as `status-code=expression="204"` (No Content), or `status-code-expression="T(org.springframework.http.HttpStatus).NO_CONTENT"`.
By default, `status-code-expression` is null meaning that the normal '200 OK' response status will be returned.
[source,xml]
----
<http:inbound-channel-adapter id="inboundController"
       channel="requests" view-name="foo" error-code="oops"
       status-code-expression="T(org.springframework.http.HttpStatus).ACCEPTED">
   <request-mapping headers="BAR"/>
</http:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

The `<http:inbound-gateway>` resolves the 'status code' from the `http_statusCode` header of the reply Message.
Starting with _version 4.2_, the default response status code when no reply is received within the `reply-timeout`
is `500 Internal Server Error`.
There are two ways to modify this behavior:

- add a `reply-timeout-status-code-expression` - this has the same semantics as the `status-code-expression` on the
inbound adapter.
- Add an `error-channel` and return an appropriate message with an http status code header, such as...

[source, xml]
----
<int:chain input-channel="errors">
    <int:header-enricher>
        <int:header name="http_statusCode" value="504" />
    </int:header-enricher>
    <int:transformer expression="payload.message" />
</int:chain>
----

The payload of the `ErrorMessage` is a `MessageTimeoutException`; it must be transformed to something that can be
converted by the gateway, such as a `String`; a good candidate is the exception's message property, which is the
value used when using the expression technique.

If the error flow times out after a main flow timeout, `500 Internal Server Error` is returned, or the
`reply-timeout-status-code-expression` is evaluated, if present.

NOTE: previously, the default status code for a timeout was `200 OK`; to restore that behavior, set
`reply-timeout-status-code-expression="200"`.

==== URI Template Variables and Expressions

By Using the _path_ attribute in conjunction with the _payload-expression_ attribute as well as the _header_ sub-element, you have a high degree of flexibility for mapping inbound request data.

In the following example configuration, an Inbound Channel Adapter is configured to accept requests using the following URI: `/first-name/{firstName}/last-name/{lastName}`

Using the _payload-expression_ attribute, the URI template variable _{firstName}_ is mapped to be the Message payload, while the _{lastName}_ URI template variable will map to the _lname_ Message header.

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-channel-adapter id="inboundAdapterWithExpressions"
    path="/first-name/{firstName}/last-name/{lastName}"
    channel="requests"
    payload-expression="#pathVariables.firstName">
    <int-http:header name="lname" expression="#pathVariables.lastName"/>
</int-http:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

For more information about _URI template variables_, please see the Spring Reference Manual: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates[uri template patterns].



Since _Spring Integration 3.0_, in addition to the existing `#pathVariables` and `#requestParams` variables being available in payload and header expressions, other useful variables have been added.

The entire list of available expression variables:



* _#requestParams_ - the `MultiValueMap` from the `ServletRequest` `parameterMap`.
* _#pathVariables_ - the `Map` from URI Template placeholders and their values;
* _#matrixVariables_ - the `Map` of `MultiValueMap` according to http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-matrix-variables[Spring MVC Specification].
Note, _#matrixVariables_ require Spring MVC 3.2 or higher;
* _#requestAttributes_ - the `org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestAttributes` associated with the current Request;
* _#requestHeaders_ - the `org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders` object from the current Request;
* _#cookies_ - the `Map<String, Cookie>` of `javax.servlet.http.Cookie` s from the current Request.



Note, all these values (and others) can be accessed within expressions in the downstream message flow via the `ThreadLocal` `org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestAttributes` variable, if that message flow is single-threaded and lives within the request thread:


[source,xml]
----
<int-:transformer
	expression="T(org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder).
	              requestAttributes.request.queryString"/>

----

==== Outbound

To configure the outbound gateway you can use the namespace support as well.
The following code snippet shows the different configuration options for an outbound Http gateway.
Most importantly, notice that the 'http-method' and 'expected-response-type' are provided.
Those are two of the most commonly configured values.
The default http-method is POST, and the default response type is _null_.
With a null response type, the payload of the reply Message would contain the ResponseEntity as long as it's http status is a success (non-successful status codes will throw Exceptions).
If you are expecting a different type, such as a `String`, then provide that fully-qualified class name as shown below.
See also the note about empty response bodies in <<http-outbound>>.

IMPORTANT: Beginning with Spring Integration 2.1 the _request-timeout_ attribute of the HTTP Outbound Gateway was renamed to _reply-timeout_ to better reflect the intent.

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="example"
    request-channel="requests"
    url="http://localhost/test"
    http-method="POST"
    extract-request-payload="false"
    expected-response-type="java.lang.String"
    charset="UTF-8"
    request-factory="requestFactory"
    reply-timeout="1234"
    reply-channel="replies"/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Since _Spring Integration 2.2_, Java serialization over HTTP is no longer enabled by default.
Previously, when setting the `expected-response-type` attribute to a `Serializable` object, the `Accept` header was not properly set up.
Since _Spring Integration 2.2_, the `SerializingHttpMessageConverter` has now been updated to set the `Accept` header to `application/x-java-serialized-object`.

However, because this could cause incompatibility with existing applications, it was decided to no longer automatically add this converter to the HTTP endpoints.
If you wish to use Java serialization, you will need to add the `SerializingHttpMessageConverter` to the appropriate endpoints, using the `message-converters` attribute, when using XML configuration, or using the `setMessageConverters()` method.
Alternatively, you may wish to consider using JSON instead which is enabled by simply having `Jackson` on the classpath.
=====

Beginning with Spring Integration 2.2 you can also determine the HTTP Method dynamically using SpEL and the _http-method-expression_ attribute.
Note that this attribute is obviously murually exclusive with _http-method_ You can also use `expected-response-type-expression` attribute instead of `expected-response-type` and provide any valid SpEL expression that determines the type of the response.
[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="example"
    request-channel="requests"
    url="http://localhost/test"
    http-method-expression="headers.httpMethod"
    extract-request-payload="false"
    expected-response-type-expression="payload"
    charset="UTF-8"
    request-factory="requestFactory"
    reply-timeout="1234"
    reply-channel="replies"/>
----

If your outbound adapter is to be used in a unidirectional way, then you can use an outbound-channel-adapter instead.
This means that a successful response will simply execute without sending any Messages to a reply channel.
In the case of any non-successful response status code, it will throw an exception.
The configuration looks very similar to the gateway:
[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-channel-adapter id="example"
    url="http://localhost/example"
    http-method="GET"
    channel="requests"
    charset="UTF-8"
    extract-payload="false"
    expected-response-type="java.lang.String"
    request-factory="someRequestFactory"
    order="3"
    auto-startup="false"/>
----

[NOTE]
=====
To specify the URL; you can use either the 'url' attribute or the 'url-expression' attribute.
The 'url' is a simple string (with placedholders for URI variables, as described below); the 'url-expression' is a SpEL expression, with the Message as the root object, enabling dynamic urls.
The url resulting from the expression evaluation can still have placeholders for URI variables.

In previous releases, some users used the place holders to replace the entire URL with a URI variable.
Changes in Spring 3.1 can cause some issues with escaped characters, such as '?'.
For this reason, it is recommended that if you wish to generate the URL entirely at runtime, you use the 'url-expression' attribute.
=====

==== Mapping URI Variables

If your URL contains URI variables, you can map them using the `uri-variable` sub-element.
This sub-element is available for the _Http Outbound Gateway_ and the _Http Outbound Channel Adapter_.

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="trafficGateway"
    url="http://local.yahooapis.com/trafficData?appid=YdnDemo&amp;zip={zipCode}"
    request-channel="trafficChannel"
    http-method="GET"
    expected-response-type="java.lang.String">
    <int-http:uri-variable name="zipCode" expression="payload.getZip()"/>
</int-http:outbound-gateway>
----

The `uri-variable` sub-element defines two attributes: `name` and `expression`.
The `name` attribute identifies the name of the URI variable, while the `expression` attribute is used to set the actual value.
Using the `expression` attribute, you can leverage the full power of the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) which gives you full dynamic access to the message payload and the message headers.
For example, in the above configuration the `getZip()` method will be invoked on the payload object of the Message and the result of that method will be used as the value for the URI variable named 'zipCode'.

Since _Spring Integration 3.0_, HTTP Outbound Endpoints support the `uri-variables-expression` attribute to specify an `Expression` which should be evaluated, resulting in a `Map` for all URI variable placeholders within the URL template.
It provides a mechanism whereby different variable expressions can be used, based on the outbound message.
This attribute is mutually exclusive with the `<uri-variable/>` sub-element:
[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway
     url="http://foo.host/{foo}/bars/{bar}"
     request-channel="trafficChannel"
     http-method="GET"
     uri-variables-expression="@uriVariablesBean.populate(payload)"
     expected-response-type="java.lang.String"/>
----

where `uriVariablesBean` might be:
[source,java]
----
public class UriVariablesBean {
	private static final ExpressionParser EXPRESSION_PARSER = new SpelExpressionParser();

	public Map<String, ?> populate(Object payload) {
		Map<String, Object> variables = new HashMap<String, Object>();
		if (payload instanceOf String.class)) {
			variables.put("foo", "foo"));
		}
		else {
			variables.put("foo", EXPRESSION_PARSER.parseExpression("headers.bar"));
		}
		return variables;
	}

}
----

NOTE: The `uri-variables-expression` must evaluate to a `Map`.
The values of the Map must be instances of `String` or `Expression`.
This Map is provided to an `ExpressionEvalMap` for further resolution of URI variable placeholders using those expressions in the context of the outbound `Message`.

==== Controlling URI Encoding

By default, the URL string is encoded (see http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriComponentsBuilder.html[UriComponentsBuilder]) to the URI object before sending the request.
In some scenarios with a non-standard URI (e.g.
the RabbitMQ Rest API) it is undesirable to perform the encoding.
The `<http:outbound-gateway/>` and `<http:outbound-channel-adapter/>` provide an `encode-uri` attribute.
To disable encoding the URL, this attribute should be set to `false` (by default it is `true`).
If you wish to partially encode some of the URL, this can be achieved using an `expression` within a `<uri-variable/>`:

[source,xml]
----
<http:outbound-gateway url="http://somehost/%2f/fooApps?bar={param}" encode-uri="false">
          <http:uri-variable name="param"
            expression="T(org.apache.commons.httpclient.util.URIUtil)
                                             .encodeWithinQuery('Hello World!')"/>
</http:outbound-gateway>

[[http-timeout]]
=== Timeout Handling

In the context of HTTP components, there are two timing areas that have to be considered.

Timeouts when interacting with Spring Integration Channels


Timeouts when interacting with a remote HTTP server

First, the components interact with Message Channels, for which timeouts can be specified.
For example, an HTTP Inbound Gateway will forward messages received from connected HTTP Clients to a Message Channel (Request Timeout) and consequently the HTTP Inbound Gateway will receive a reply Message from the Reply Channel (Reply Timeout) that will be used to generate the HTTP Response.
Please see the figure below for an illustration.

.How timeout settings apply to an HTTP Inbound Gateway
image::images/http-inbound-gateway.png[align="center"]

For outbound endpoints, the second thing to consider is timing while interacting with the remote server.

.How timeout settings apply to an HTTP Outbound Gateway
image::images/http-outbound-gateway.png[align="center"]

You may want to configure the HTTP related timeout behavior, when making active HTTP requests using the _HTTP Oubound Gateway_ or the _HTTP Outbound Channel Adapter_.
In those instances, these two components use Spring'shttp://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html[RestTemplate] support to execute HTTP requests.

In order to configure timeouts for the _HTTP Oubound Gateway_ and the _HTTP Outbound Channel Adapter_, you can either reference a `RestTemplate` bean directly, using the _rest-template_ attribute, or you can provide a reference to a http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/ClientHttpRequestFactory.html[ClientHttpRequestFactory] bean using the _request-factory_ attribute.
Spring provides the following implementations of the `ClientHttpRequestFactory` interface:

http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory.html[SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory] - Uses standard J2SE facilities for making HTTP Requests

http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.html[HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory] - Uses http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/[Apache HttpComponents HttpClient] (Since Spring 3.1)

http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory.html[ClientHttpRequestFactory] - Uses http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/[Jakarta Commons HttpClient] (Deprecated as of Spring 3.1)

If you don't explicitly configure the _request-factory_ or _rest-template_ attribute respectively, then a default RestTemplate which uses a `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` will be instantiated.

[NOTE]
=====
With some JVM implementations, the handling of timeouts using the _URLConnection_ class may not be consistent.

E.g.
from the _Java™ Platform, Standard Edition 6 API Specification_ on _setConnectTimeout_: [quote]
Some non-standard implmentation of this method may ignore the specified timeout.
To see the connect timeout set, please call getConnectTimeout().

Please test your timeouts if you have specific needs.
Consider using the `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` which, in turn, uses http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/[Apache HttpComponents HttpClient] instead.
=====

IMPORTANT: When using the _Apache HttpComponents HttpClient_ with a Pooling Connection Manager, be aware that, by default, the connection manager will create no more than 2 concurrent connections per given route and no more than 20 connections in total.
For many real-world applications these limits may prove too constraining.
Refer to the Apache documentation (link above) for information about configuring this important component.

Here is an example of how to configure an _HTTP Outbound Gateway_ using a `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`, configured with connect and read timeouts of 5 seconds respectively:

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway url="http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather={city}"
                           http-method="GET"
                           expected-response-type="java.lang.String"
                           request-factory="requestFactory"
                           request-channel="requestChannel"
                           reply-channel="replyChannel">
    <int-http:uri-variable name="city" expression="payload"/>
</int-http:outbound-gateway>

<bean id="requestFactory"
      class="org.springframework.http.client.SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory">
    <property name="connectTimeout" value="5000"/>
    <property name="readTimeout"    value="5000"/>
</bean>
----

_HTTP Outbound Gateway_

For the _HTTP Outbound Gateway_, the XML Schema defines only the _reply-timeout_.
The _reply-timeout_ maps to the _sendTimeout_ property of the _org.springframework.integration.http.outbound.HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler_ class.
More precisely, the property is set on the extended `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler` class, which ultimatelly sets the property on the _MessagingTemplate_.

The value of the _sendTimeout_ property defaults to "-1" and will be applied to the connected `MessageChannel`.
This means, that depending on the implementation, the Message Channel's_send_ method may block indefinitely.
Furthermore, the _sendTimeout_ property is only used, when the actual MessageChannel implementation has a blocking send (such as 'full' bounded QueueChannel).

_HTTP Inbound Gateway_

For the _HTTP Inbound Gateway_, the XML Schema defines the _request-timeout_ attribute, which will be used to set the _requestTimeout_ property on the `HttpRequestHandlingMessagingGateway` class (on the extended MessagingGatewaySupport class).
Secondly, the_reply-timeout_ attribute exists and it maps to the _replyTimeout_ property on the same class.

The default for both timeout properties is "1000ms".
Ultimately, the _request-timeout_ property will be used to set the _sendTimeout_ on the used `MessagingTemplate` instance.
The _replyTimeout_ property on the other hand, will be used to set the _receiveTimeout_ property on the used `MessagingTemplate` instance.

TIP: In order to simulate connection timeouts, connect to a non-routable IP address, for example 10.255.255.10.

[[http-proxy]]
=== HTTP Proxy configuration

If you are behind a proxy and need to configure proxy settings for HTTP outbound adapters and/or gateways, you can apply one of two approaches.
In most cases, you can rely on the standard Java System Properties that control the proxy settings.
Otherwise, you can explicitly configure a Spring bean for the HTTP client request factory instance.

_Standard Java Proxy configuration_

There are 3 System Properties you can set to configure the proxy settings that will be used by the HTTP protocol handler:

* _http.proxyHost_ - the host name of the proxy server.
* _http.proxyPort_ - the port number, the default value being 80.
* _http.nonProxyHosts_ - a list of hosts that should be reached directly, bypassing the proxy.
This is a list of patterns separated by '|'.
The patterns may start or end with a '*' for wildcards.
Any host matching one of these patterns will be reached through a direct connection instead of through a proxy.



And for HTTPS:

* _https.proxyHost_ - the host name of the proxy server.
* _https.proxyPort_ - the port number, the default value being 80.



For more information please refer to this document: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

_Spring's SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory_

If for any reason, you need more explicit control over the proxy configuration, you can use Spring's `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory` and configure its 'proxy' property as such:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="requestFactory"
    class="org.springframework.http.client.SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory">
    <property name="proxy">
        <bean id="proxy" class="java.net.Proxy">
            <constructor-arg>
                <util:constant static-field="java.net.Proxy.Type.HTTP"/>
            </constructor-arg>
            <constructor-arg>
                <bean class="java.net.InetSocketAddress">
                    <constructor-arg value="123.0.0.1"/>
                    <constructor-arg value="8080"/>
                </bean>
            </constructor-arg>
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>
----

[[http-header-mapping]]
=== HTTP Header Mappings

Spring Integration provides support for Http Header mapping for both HTTP Request and HTTP Responses.

By default all standard Http Headers as defined here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields will be mapped from the message to HTTP request/response headers without further configuration.
However if you do need further customization you may provide additional configuration via convenient namespace support.
You can provide a comma-separated list of header names, and you can also include simple patterns with the '*' character acting as a wildcard.
If you do provide such values, it will override the default behavior.
Basically, it assumes you are in complete control at that point.
However, if you do want to include all of the standard HTTP headers, you can use the shortcut patterns: HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS and HTTP_RESPONSE_HEADERS.
Here are some examples:
[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="httpGateway"
    url="http://localhost/test2"
    mapped-request-headers="foo, bar"
    mapped-response-headers="X-*, HTTP_RESPONSE_HEADERS"
    channel="someChannel"/>

<int-http:outbound-channel-adapter id="httpAdapter"
    url="http://localhost/test2"
    mapped-request-headers="foo, bar, HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS"
    channel="someChannel"/>
----

The adapters and gateways will use the `DefaultHttpHeaderMapper` which now provides two static factory methods for "inbound" and "outbound" adapters so that the proper direction can be applied (mapping HTTP requests/responses IN/OUT as appropriate).

If further customization is required you can also configure a `DefaultHttpHeaderMapper` independently and inject it into the adapter via the `header-mapper` attribute.

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="httpGateway"
    url="http://localhost/test2"
    header-mapper="headerMapper"
    channel="someChannel"/>

<bean id="headerMapper" class="o.s.i.http.support.DefaultHttpHeaderMapper">
    <property name="inboundHeaderNames" value="foo*, *bar, baz"/>
    <property name="outboundHeaderNames" value="a*b, d"/>
</bean>
----

Of course, you can even implement the HeaderMapper strategy interface directly and provide a reference to that if you need to do something other than what the `DefaultHttpHeaderMapper` supports.

[[multipart-rest-inbound]]
==== Multipart HTTP request - RestTemplate (client) and Http Inbound Gateway (server)

This example demonstrates how simple it is to send a Multipart HTTP request via Spring's RestTemplate and receive it with a Spring Integration HTTP Inbound Adapter.
All we are doing is creating a `MultiValueMap` and populating it with multi-part data.
The `RestTemplate` will take care of the rest (no pun intended) by converting it to a `MultipartHttpServletRequest` . This particular client will send a multipart HTTP Request which contains the name of the company as well as an image file with the company logo.
[source,java]
----
RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();
String uri = "http://localhost:8080/multipart-http/inboundAdapter.htm";
Resource s2logo = 
   new ClassPathResource("org/springframework/samples/multipart/spring09_logo.png");
MultiValueMap map = new LinkedMultiValueMap();
map.add("company", "SpringSource");
map.add("company-logo", s2logo);
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setContentType(new MediaType("multipart", "form-data"));
HttpEntity request = new HttpEntity(map, headers);
ResponseEntity<?> httpResponse = template.exchange(uri, HttpMethod.POST, request, null);
----

That is all for the client.

On the server side we have the following configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<int-http:inbound-channel-adapter id="httpInboundAdapter"
    channel="receiveChannel"
    path="/inboundAdapter.htm"
    supported-methods="GET, POST"/>

<int:channel id="receiveChannel"/>

<int:service-activator input-channel="receiveChannel">
    <bean class="org.springframework.integration.samples.multipart.MultipartReceiver"/>
</int:service-activator>

<bean id="multipartResolver"
    class="org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver"/>
----

The 'httpInboundAdapter' will receive the request, convert it to a `Message` with a payload that is a `LinkedMultiValueMap`.
We then are parsing that in the 'multipartReceiver' service-activator;
[source,java]
----
public void receive(LinkedMultiValueMap<String, Object> multipartRequest){
    System.out.println("### Successfully received multipart request ###");
    for (String elementName : multipartRequest.keySet()) {
        if (elementName.equals("company")){
            System.out.println("\t" + elementName + " - " +
                ((String[]) multipartRequest.getFirst("company"))[0]);
        }
        else if (elementName.equals("company-logo")){
            System.out.println("\t" + elementName + " - as UploadedMultipartFile: " +
                ((UploadedMultipartFile) multipartRequest
                    .getFirst("company-logo")).getOriginalFilename());
        }
    }
}


----

You should see the following output:
[source,xml]
----
### Successfully received multipart request ###
   company - SpringSource
   company-logo - as UploadedMultipartFile: spring09_logo.png
----

== TCP and UDP Support

Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending messages over internet protocols.
Both UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) adapters are provided.
Each adapter provides for one-way communication over the underlying protocol.
In addition, simple inbound and outbound tcp gateways are provided.
These are used when two-way communication is needed.

[[ip-intro]]
=== Introduction

Two flavors each of UDP inbound and outbound channel adapters are provided `UnicastSendingMessageHandler` sends a datagram packet to a single destination.
`UnicastReceivingChannelAdapter` receives incoming datagram packets.
`MulticastSendingMessageHandler` sends (broadcasts) datagram packets to a multicast address.
`MulticastReceivingChannelAdapter` receives incoming datagram packets by joining to a multicast address.

TCP inbound and outbound channel adapters are provided `TcpSendingMessageHandler` sends messages over TCP.
`TcpReceivingChannelAdapter` receives messages over TCP.

An inbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing.
While the gateway can support any number of connections, each connection can only process serially.
The thread that reads from the socket waits for, and sends, the response before reading again.
If the connection factory is configured for single use connections, the connection is closed after the socket times out.

An outbound TCP gateway is provided; this allows for simple request/response processing.
If the associated connection factory is configured for single use connections, a new connection is immediately created for each new request.
Otherwise, if the connection is in use, the calling thread blocks on the connection until either a response is received or a timeout or I/O error occurs.

The TCP and UDP inbound channel adapters, and the TCP inbound gateway, support the "error-channel" attribute.
This provides the same basic functionality as described in <<gateway-proxy>>.

[[udp-adapters]]
=== UDP Adapters

<int-ip:udp-outbound-channel-adapter id="udpOut"
    host="somehost"
    port="11111"
    multicast="false"
    channel="exampleChannel"/>
----

A simple UDP outbound channel adapter.

TIP: When setting multicast to true, provide the multicast address in the host attribute.

UDP is an efficient, but unreliable protocol.
Two attributes are added to improve reliability.
When check-length is set to true, the adapter precedes the message data with a length field (4 bytes in network byte order).
This enables the receiving side to verify the length of the packet received.
If a receiving system uses a buffer that is too short the contain the packet, the packet can be truncated.
The length header provides a mechanism to detect this.

[source,xml]
----
<int-ip:udp-outbound-channel-adapter id="udpOut"
    host="somehost"
    port="11111"
    multicast="false"
    check-length="true"
    channel="exampleChannel"/>
----

An outbound channel adapter that adds length checking to the datagram packets.

TIP: The recipient of the packet must also be configured to expect a length to precede the actual data.
For a Spring Integration UDP inbound channel adapter, set its `check-length` attribute.

The second reliability improvement allows an application-level acknowledgment protocol to be used.
The receiver must send an acknowledgment to the sender within a specified time.

[source,xml]
----
<int-ip:udp-outbound-channel-adapter id="udpOut"
    host="somehost"
    port="11111"

    acknowledge="true"
    ack-host="thishost"
    ack-port="22222"
    ack-timeout="10000"
    channel="exampleChannel"/>
----

An outbound channel adapter that adds length checking to the datagram packets and waits for an acknowledgment.

TIP: Setting acknowledge to true implies the recipient of the packet can interpret the header added to the packet containing acknowledgment data (host and port).
Most likely, the recipient will be a Spring Integration inbound channel adapter.

TIP: When multicast is true, an additional attribute min-acks-for-success specifies how many acknowledgments must be received within the ack-timeout.

For even more reliable networking, TCP can be used.

    multicast-address="225.6.7.8"
    check-length="true"/>
----

A basic multicast inbound udp channel adapter.

By default, reverse DNS lookups are done on inbound packets to convert IP addresses to hostnames for use in message headers.
In environments where DNS is not configured, this can cause delays.
This default behavior can be overridden by setting the `lookup-host` attribute to "false".

[[connection-factories]]
=== TCP Connection Factories

For TCP, the configuration of the underlying connection is provided using a Connection Factory.
Two types of connection factory are provided; a client connection factory and a server connection factory.
Client connection factories are used to establish outgoing connections; Server connection factories listen for incoming connections.

A client connection factory is used by an outbound channel adapter but a reference to a client connection factory can also be provided to an inbound channel adapter and that adapter will receive any incoming messages received on connections created by the outbound adapter.

A server connection factory is used by an inbound channel adapter or gateway (in fact the connection factory will not function without one).
A reference to a server connection factory can also be provided to an outbound adapter; that adapter can then be used to send replies to incoming messages to the same connection.

TIP: Reply messages will only be routed to the connection if the reply contains the header `ip_connectionId` that was inserted into the original message by the connection factory.

TIP: This is the extent of message correlation performed when sharing connection factories between inbound and outbound adapters.
Such sharing allows for asynchronous two-way communication over TCP.
By default, only payload information is transferred using TCP; therefore any message correlation must be performed by downstream components such as aggregators or other endpoints.
Support for transferring selected headers was introduced in version 3.0.
For more information refer to <<ip-correlation>>.

A maximum of one adapter of each type may be given a reference to a connection factory.

Connection factories using `java.net.Socket` and `java.nio.channel.SocketChannel` are provided.

[source,xml]

----

A simple server connection factory that uses `java.nio.channel.SocketChannel` connections.

NOTE: Starting with Spring Integration _version 4.2_, if the server is configured to listen on a random port (0),
the actual port chosen by the OS can be obtained using `getPort()`.
Also, `getServerSocketAddress()` is available to get the complete `SocketAddress`.
See the javadocs for the `TcpServerConnectionFactory` interface for more information.

    host="localhost"
    port="1234"

    so-timeout="10000"
    using-nio=true/>
----

A client connection factory that uses `java.nio.channel.Socket` connections and creates a new connection for each message.

TCP is a streaming protocol; this means that some structure has to be provided to data transported over TCP, so the receiver can demarcate the data into discrete messages.
Connection factories are configured to use (de)serializers to convert between the message payload and the bits that are sent over TCP.
This is accomplished by providing a deserializer and serializer for inbound and outbound messages respectively.
A number of standard (de)serializers are provided.

The `ByteArrayCrlfSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes followed by carriage return and linefeed characters (\r\n).
This is the default (de)serializer and can be used with telnet as a client, for example.

The `ByteArraySingleTerminatorSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes followed by a single termination character (default 0x00).

The `ByteArrayLfSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes followed by a single linefeed character (0x0a).

The `ByteArrayStxEtxSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes preceded by an STX (0x02) and followed by an ETX (0x03).

The `ByteArrayLengthHeaderSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes preceded by a binary length in network byte order (big endian).
This a very efficient deserializer because it does not have to parse every byte looking for a termination character sequence.
It can also be used for payloads containing binary data; the above serializers only support text in the payload.
The default size of the length header is 4 bytes (Integer), allowing for messages up to (2^31 - 1) bytes.
However, the length header can be a single byte (unsigned) for messages up to 255 bytes, or an unsigned short (2 bytes) for messages up to (2^16 - 1) bytes.
If you need any other format for the header, you can subclass this class and provide implementations for the readHeader and writeHeader methods.
The absolute maximum data size supported is (2^31 - 1) bytes.

The `ByteArrayRawSerializer`, converts a byte array to a stream of bytes and adds no additional message demarcation data; with this (de)serializer, the end of a message is indicated by the client closing the socket in an orderly fashion.
When using this serializer, message reception will hang until the client closes the socket, or a timeout occurs; a timeout will NOT result in a message.
When this serializer is being used, and the client is a Spring Integration application, the client must use a connection factory that is configured with single-use=true - this causes the adapter to close the socket after sending the message; the serializer will not, itself, close the connection.
This serializer should only be used with connection factories used by channel adapters (not gateways), and the connection factories should be used by either an inbound or outbound adapter, and not both.

NOTE: Before version 4.2.2, when using NIO, this serializer treated a timeout (during read) as an end of file and the
data read so far was emitted as a message.
This is unreliable and should not be used to delimit messages; it now treats such conditions as an exception.
In the unlikely event you are using it this way, the previous behavior can be restored by setting the
`treatTimeoutAsEndOfMessage` constructor argument to `true`.

Each of these is a subclass of `AbstractByteArraySerializer` which implements both `org.springframework.core.serializer.Serializer` and `org.springframework.core.serializer.Deserializer`.
For backwards compatibility, connections using any subclass of `AbstractByteArraySerializer` for serialization will also accept a String which will be converted to a byte array first.
Each of these (de)serializers converts an input stream containing the corresponding format to a byte array payload.

To avoid memory exhaustion due to a badly behaved client (one that does not adhere to the protocol of the configured serializer), these serializers impose a maximum message size.
If the size is exceeded by an incoming message, an exception will be thrown.
The default maximum message size is 2048 bytes, and can be increased by setting the `maxMessageSize` property.
If you are using the default (de)serializer and wish to increase the maximum message size, you must declare it as an explicit bean with the property set and configure the connection factory to use that bean.

The `MapJsonSerializer` uses a Jackson `ObjectMapper` to convert between a `Map` and JSON.
This can be used in conjunction with a `MessageConvertingTcpMessageMapper` and a `MapMessageConverter` to transfer selected headers and the payload in a JSON format.

NOTE: The Jackson `ObjectMapper` cannot demarcate messages in the stream.
Therefore, the `MapJsonSerializer` needs to delegate to another (de)serializer to handle message demarcation.
By default, a `ByteArrayLfSerializer` is used, resulting in messages with the format `<json><LF>` on the wire, but you can configure it to use others instead.

The final standard serializer is `org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultSerializer` which can be used to convert Serializable objects using java serialization.`org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultDeserializer` is provided for inbound deserialization of streams containing Serializable objects.

To implement a custom (de)serializer pair, implement the `org.springframework.core.serializer.Deserializer` and `org.springframework.core.serializer.Serializer` interfaces.

If you do not wish to use the default (de)serializer (`ByteArrayCrLfSerializer`), you must supply `serializer` and `deserializer` attributes on the connection factory (example below).

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="javaSerializer"
      class="org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultSerializer" />
<bean id="javaDeserializer"
      class="org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultDeserializer" />

<int-ip:tcp-connection-factory id="server"
    type="server"
    port="1234"
    deserializer="javaDeserializer"
    serializer="javaSerializer"/>
----

A server connection factory that uses `java.net.Socket` connections and uses Java serialization on the wire.

For full details of the attributes available on connection factories, see the reference at the end of this section.

By default, reverse DNS lookups are done on inbound packets to convert IP addresses to hostnames for use in message headers.
In environments where DNS is not configured, this can cause connection delays.
This default behavior can be overridden by setting the `lookup-host` attribute to "false".

NOTE: It is possible to modify the creation of and/or attributes of sockets - see <<ssl-tls>>.
As is noted there, such modifications are possible whether or not SSL is being used.

[[caching-cf]]
==== TCP Caching Client Connection Factory

As noted above, TCP sockets can be 'single-use' (one request/response) or shared.
Shared sockets do not perform well with outbound gateways, in high-volume environments, because the socket can only process one request/response at a time.

To improve performance, users could use collaborating channel adapters instead of gateways, but that requires application-level message correlation.
See <<ip-correlation>> for more information.

Spring Integration 2.2 introduced a caching client connection factory, where a pool of shared sockets is used, allowing a gateway to process multiple concurrent requests with a pool of shared connections.

[[failover-cf]]
==== TCP Failover Client Connection Factory

It is now possible to configure a TCP connection factory that supports failover to one or more other servers.
When sending a message, the factory will iterate over all its configured factories until either the message can be sent, or no connection can be found.
Initially, the first factory in the configured list is used; if a connection subsequently fails the next factory will become the current factory.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="failCF" class="o.s.i.ip.tcp.connection.FailoverClientConnectionFactory">
    <constructor-arg>
        <list>
            <ref bean="clientFactory1"/>
            <ref bean="clientFactory2"/>
        </list>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>
----

NOTE: When using the failover connection factory, the singleUse property must be consistent between the factory itself and the list of factories it is configured to use.

[[ip-interceptors]]
=== TCP Connection Interceptors

Connection factories can be configured with a reference to a `TcpConnectionInterceptorFactoryChain`.
Interceptors can be used to add behavior to connections, such as negotiation, security, and other setup.
No interceptors are currently provided by the framework but, for an example, see the `InterceptedSharedConnectionTests` in the source repository.

The `HelloWorldInterceptor` used in the test case works as follows:

When configured with a client connection factory, when the first message is sent over a connection that is intercepted, the interceptor sends 'Hello' over the connection, and expects to receive 'world!'.
When that occurs, the negotiation is complete and the original message is sent; further messages that use the same connection are sent without any additional negotiation.

When configured with a server connection factory, the interceptor requires the first message to be 'Hello' and, if it is, returns 'world!'.
Otherwise it throws an exception causing the connection to be closed.

All `TcpConnection` methods are intercepted.
Interceptor instances are created for each connection by an interceptor factory.
If an interceptor is stateful, the factory should create a new instance for each connection; if there is no state, the same interceptor can wrap each connection.
Interceptor factories are added to the configuration of an interceptor factory chain, which is provided to a connection factory using the `interceptor-factory` attribute.
Interceptors must extend `TcpConnectionInterceptorSupport`; factories must implement the `TcpConnectionInterceptorFactory` interface.
`TcpConnectionInterceptorSupport` is provided with passthrough methods; by extending this class, you only need to implement those methods you wish to intercept.

[source,xml]

[[tcp-events]]
=== TCP Connection Events

Beginning with version 3.0, changes to `TcpConnection` s are reported by `TcpConnectionEvent` s.
`TcpConnectionEvent` is a subclass of `ApplicationEvent` and thus can be received by any `ApplicationListener` defined in the `ApplicationContext`.

[NOTE]
=====
The following is deprecated as of _version 4.2_; use the generic Event Inbound Channel Adapter instead.
See <<appevent-inbound>>.

For convenience, a `<int-ip:tcp-connection-event-inbound-channel-adapter/>` is provided.
This adapter will receive all `TcpConnectionEvent` s (by default), and send them to its `channel`.
The adapter accepts an `event-type` attribute, which is a list of class names for events that should be sent.
This can be used if an application subclasses `TcpConnectionEvent` for some reason, and wishes to only receive those events.
Omitting this attribute will mean that all `TcpConnectionEvent` s will be sent.
You can also use this to limit which `TcpConnectionEvent` s you are interested in ( `TcpConnectionOpenEvent`, `TcpConnectionCloseEvent`, or `TcpConnectionExceptionEvent`).
=====


`TcpConnectionEvents` have the following properties:

* `connectionId` - the connection identifier which can be used in a message header to send data to the connection
* `connectionFactoryName` - the bean name of the connection factory the connection belongs to
* `throwable` - the `Throwable` (for `TcpConnectionExceptionEvent` events only)
* `source` - the `TcpConnection`; this can be used, for example, to determine the remote IP Address with `getHostAddress()` (cast required)

In addition, since _version 4.0_ the standard deserializers discussed in <<connection-factories>> now emit `TcpDeserializationExceptionEvent` s when problems are encountered decoding the data stream.
These events contain the exception, the buffer that was in the process of being built, and an offset into the buffer (if available) at the point the exception occurred.
Applications can use a normal `ApplicationListener`, or see <<appevent-inbound>>, to capture these events, allowing analysis of the problem.

Starting with _versions 4.0.7, 4.1.3_, `TcpConnectionServerExceptionEvent` s are published whenever an unexpected exception occurs on a server socket (such as a `BindException` when the server socket is in use).
These events have a reference to the connection factory and the cause.

Starting with _version 4.2_, `TcpConnectionFailedCorrelationEvent` s are published whenever an endpoint (inbound gateway or
collaborating outbound channel adapter) receives a message that cannot be routed to a connection because the
`ip_connectionId` header is invalid.
Outbound gateways also publish this event when a late reply is received (the sender thread has timed out).
The event contains the connection id as well as an exception in the `cause` property that contains the failed message.

[[tcp-adapters]]
=== TCP Adapters

TCP inbound and outbound channel adapters that utilize the above connection factories are provided.
These adapters have attributes `connection-factory` and `channel`.
The channel attribute specifies the channel on which messages arrive at an outbound adapter and on which messages are placed by an inbound adapter.
The connection-factory attribute indicates which connection factory is to be used to manage connections for the adapter.
While both inbound and outbound adapters can share a connection factory, server connection factories are always 'owned' by an inbound adapter; client connection factories are always 'owned' by an outbound adapter.
One, and only one, adapter of each type may get a reference to a connection factory.

[source,xml]

      class="org.springframework.core.serializer.DefaultSerializer"/>

    single-use="true"/>

<int-ip:tcp-connection-factory id="client"
    type="client"
    host="localhost"
    port="#{server.port}"
    single-use="true"
    so-timeout="10000"
    deserializer="javaDeserializer"
    serializer="javaSerializer"/>

<int:channel id="input" />

<int:channel id="replies">
    <int:queue/>
</int:channel>

<int-ip:tcp-outbound-channel-adapter id="outboundClient"
    channel="input"
    connection-factory="client"/>

<int-ip:tcp-inbound-channel-adapter id="inboundClient"
    channel="replies"
    connection-factory="client"/>

<int-ip:tcp-inbound-channel-adapter id="inboundServer"
    channel="loop"
    connection-factory="server"/>

<int-ip:tcp-outbound-channel-adapter id="outboundServer"
    channel="loop"
    connection-factory="server"/>

<int:channel id="loop"/>
----

In this configuration, messages arriving in channel 'input' are serialized over connections created by 'client' received at the server and placed on channel 'loop'.
Since 'loop' is the input channel for 'outboundServer' the message is simply looped back over the same connection and received by 'inboundClient' and deposited in channel 'replies'.
Java serialization is used on the wire.

Normally, inbound adapters use a type="server" connection factory, which listens for incoming connection requests.
In some cases, it is desirable to establish the connection in reverse, whereby the inbound adapter connects to an external server and then waits for inbound messages on that connection.

This topology is supported by using _client-mode="true"_ on the inbound adapter.
In this case, the connection factory must be of type 'client' and must have _single-use_ set to false.

Two additional attributes are used to support this mechanism: _retry-interval_ specifies (in milliseconds) how often the framework will attempt to reconnect after a connection failure.
_scheduler_ is used to supply a `TaskScheduler` used to schedule the connection attempts, and to test that the connection is still active.

For an outbound adapter, the connection is normally established when the first message is sent.
_client-mode="true"_ on an outbound adapter will cause the connection to be established when the adapter is started.
Adapters are automatically started by default.
Again, the connection factory must be of type client and have _single-use_ set to false and _retry-interval_ and _scheduler_ are also supported.
If a connection fails, it will be re-established either by the scheduler or when the next message is sent.

For both inbound and outbound, if the adapter is started, you may force the adapter to establish a connection by sending a <control-bus /> command: `@adapter_id.retryConnection()` and examine the current state with `@adapter_id.isConnected()`.

[[tcp-gateways]]
=== TCP Gateways

The inbound TCP gateway `TcpInboundGateway` and outbound TCP gateway `TcpOutboundGateway` use a server and client connection factory respectively.
Each connection can process a single request/response at a time.

The inbound gateway, after constructing a message with the incoming payload and sending it to the requestChannel, waits for a response and sends the payload from the response message by writing it to the connection.

NOTE: For the inbound gateway, care must be taken to retain, or populate, the _ip_connectionId_ header because it is used to correlate the message to a connection.
Messages that originate at the gateway will automatically have the header set.
If the reply is constructed as a new message, you will need to set the header.
The header value can be captured from the incoming message.

As with inbound adapters, inbound gateways normally use a type="server" connection factory, which listens for incoming connection requests.
In some cases, it is desirable to establish the connection in reverse, whereby the inbound gateway connects to an external server and then waits for, and replies to, inbound messages on that connection.

This topology is supported by using _client-mode="true"_ on the inbound gateway.
In this case, the connection factory must be of type 'client' and must have _single-use_ set to false.

Two additional attributes are used to support this mechanism: _retry-interval_ specifies (in milliseconds) how often the framework will attempt to reconnect after a connection failure.
_scheduler_ is used to supply a `TaskScheduler` used to schedule the connection attempts, and to test that the connection is still active.

If the gateway is started, you may force the gateway to establish a connection by sending a <control-bus /> command: `@adapter_id.retryConnection()` and examine the current state with `@adapter_id.isConnected()`.

The outbound gateway, after sending a message over the connection, waits for a response and constructs a response message and puts in on the reply channel.
Communications over the connections are single-threaded.
Users should be aware that only one message can be handled at a time and, if another thread attempts to send a message before the current response has been received, it will block until any previous requests are complete (or time out).
If, however, the client connection factory is configured for single-use connections each new request gets its own connection and is processed immediately.

[[ip-correlation]]
=== TCP Message Correlation

==== Overview

One goal of the IP Endpoints is to provide communication with systems other than another Spring Integration application.
For this reason, only message payloads are sent and received, by default.
Since 3.0, headers can be transferred, using JSON, Java serialization, or with custom `Serializer` s and `Deserializer` s; see <<ip-headers>> for more information.
No message correlation is provided by the framework, except when using the gateways, or collaborating channel adapters on the server side.
In the paragraphs below we discuss the various correlation techniques available to applications.
In most cases, this requires specific application-level correlation of messages, even when message payloads contain some natural correlation data (such as an order number).

==== Gateways

The gateways will automatically correlate messages.
However, an outbound gateway should only be used for relatively low-volume use.
When the connection factory is configured for a single shared connection to be used for all message pairs ('single-use="false"'), only one message can be processed at a time.
A new message will have to wait until the reply to the previous message has been received.
When a connection factory is configured for each new message to use a new connection ('single-use="true"'), the above restriction does not apply.
While this may give higher throughput than a shared connection environment, it comes with the overhead of opening and closing a new connection for each message pair.

Therefore, for high-volume messages, consider using a collaborating pair of channel adapters.
However, you will need to provide collaboration logic.

Another solution, introduced in Spring Integration 2.2, is to use a `CachingClientConnectionFactory`, which allows the use of a pool of shared connections.

==== Collaborating Outbound and Inbound Channel Adapters

To achieve high-volume throughput (avoiding the pitfalls of using gateways as mentioned above) you may consider configuring a pair of collaborating outbound and inbound channel adapters.
Collaborating adapters can also be used (server-side or client-side) for totally asynchronous communication (rather than with request/reply semantics).
On the server side, message correlation is automatically handled by the adapters because the inbound adapter adds a header allowing the outbound adapter to determine which connection to use to send the reply message.

NOTE: On the server side, care must be taken to populate the _ip_connectionId_ header because it is used to correlate the message to a connection.
Messages that originate at the inbound adapter will automatically have the header set.
If you wish to construct other messages to send, you will need to set the header.
The header value can be captured from an incoming message.

On the client side, the application will have to provide its own correlation logic, if needed.
This can be done in a number of ways.

If the message payload has some natural correlation data, such as a transaction id or an order number, AND there is no need to retain any information (such as a reply channel header) from the original outbound message, the correlation is simple and would done at the application level in any case.

If the message payload has some natural correlation data, such as a transaction id or an order number, but there is a need to retain some information (such as a reply channel header) from the original outbound message, you may need to retain a copy of the original outbound message (perhaps by using a publish-subscribe channel) and use an aggregator to recombine the necessary data.

For either of the previous two paragraphs, if the payload has no natural correlation data, you may need to provide a transformer upstream of the outbound channel adapter to enhance the payload with such data.
Such a transformer may transform the original payload to a new object containing both the original payload and some subset of the message headers.
Of course, live objects (such as reply channels) from the headers can not be included in the transformed payload.

If such a strategy is chosen you will need to ensure the connection factory has an appropriate serializer/deserializer pair to handle such a payload, such as the `DefaultSerializer/Deserializer` which use java serialization, or a custom serializer and deserializer.
The `ByteArray*Serializer` options mentioned in <<connection-factories>>, including the default `ByteArrayCrLfSerializer`, do not support such payloads, unless the transformed payload is a `String` or `byte[]`,

[NOTE]
=====
Before the 2.2 release, when a _client_ connection factory was used by collaborating channel adapters, the _so-timeout_ attribute defaulted to the default reply timeout (10 seconds).
This meant that if no data were received by the inbound adapter for this period of time, the socket was closed.

This default behavior was not appropriate in a truly asynchronous environment, so it now defaults to an infinite timeout.
You can reinstate the previous default behavior by setting the _so-timeout_ attribute on the client connection factory to 10000 milliseconds.
=====

[[ip-headers]]
==== Transferring Headers

TCP is a streaming protocol; `Serializers` and `Deserializers` are used to demarcate messages within the stream.
Prior to 3.0, only message payloads (String or byte[]) could be transferred over TCP.
Beginning with 3.0, you can now transfer selected headers as well as the payload.
It is important to understand, though, that "live" objects, such as the `replyChannel` header cannot be serialized.

Sending header information over TCP requires some additional configuration.

The first step is to provide the `ConnectionFactory` with a `MessageConvertingTcpMessageMapper` using the `mapper` attribute.
This mapper delegates to any `MessageConverter` implementation to convert the message to/from some object that can be (de)serialized by the configured `serializer` and `deserializer`.

A `MapMessageConverter` is provided, which allows the specification of a list of headers that will be added to a `Map` object, along with the payload.
The generated Map has two entries: `payload` and `headers`.
The `headers` entry is itself a `Map` containing the selected headers.

The second step is to provide a (de)serializer that can convert between a `Map` and some wire format.
This can be a custom `(de)Serializer`, which would typically be needed if the peer system is not a Spring Integration application.

A `MapJsonSerializer` is provided that will convert a Map to/from JSON.
This uses a Spring Integration `JsonObjectMapper` to perform this function.
You can provide a custom `JsonObjectMapper` if needed.
By default, the serializer inserts a linefeed`0x0a` character between objects.
See the JavaDocs for more information.

NOTE: At the time of writing, the `JsonObjectMapper` uses whichever version of `Jackson` is on the classpath.

You can also use standard Java serialization of the Map, using the `DefaultSerializer` and `DefaultDeserializer`.

The following example shows the configuration of a connection factory that transfers the `correlationId`, `sequenceNumber`, and `sequenceSize` headers using JSON.

[source,xml]
----
<int-ip:tcp-connection-factory id="client"
    type="client"
    host="localhost"
    port="12345"
    mapper="mapper"
    serializer="jsonSerializer"
    deserializer="jsonSerializer"/>

<bean id="mapper"
      class="o.sf.integration.ip.tcp.connection.MessageConvertingTcpMessageMapper">

                    <value>sequenceNumber</value>
                    <value>sequenceSize</value>

        </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>

<bean id="jsonSerializer" class="o.sf.integration.ip.tcp.serializer.MapJsonSerializer" />

A message sent with the above configuration, with payload 'foo' would appear on the wire like so:

{"headers":{"correlationId":"bar","sequenceSize":5,"sequenceNumber":1},"payload":"foo"}

[[note_nio]]
=== A Note About NIO

Using NIO (see `using-nio` in <<ip-endpoint-reference>>) avoids dedicating a thread to read from each socket.
For a small number of sockets, you will likely find that _not_ using NIO, together with an async handoff (e.g.
to a `QueueChannel`), will perform as well as, or better than, using NIO.

Consider using NIO when handling a large number of connections.
However, the use of NIO has some other ramifications.
A pool of threads (in the task executor) is shared across all the sockets; each incoming message is assembled and sent to the configured channel as a separate unit of work on a thread selected from that pool.
Two sequential messages arriving on the _same_ socket _might_ be processed by different threads.
This means that the order in which the messages are sent to the channel is indeterminate; the strict ordering of the messages arriving on the socket is not maintained.

For some applications, this is not an issue; for others it is.
If strict ordering is required, consider setting `using-nio` to false and using async handoff.

Alternatively, you may choose to insert a resequencer downstream of the inbound endpoint to return the messages to their proper sequence.
Set _apply-sequence_ to true on the connection factory, and messages arriving on a TCP connection will have _sequenceNumber_ and _correlationId_ headers set.
The resequencer uses these headers to return the messages to their proper sequence.

_Pool Size_

The pool size attribute is no longer used; previously, it specified the size of the default thread pool when a task-executor was not specified.
It was also used to set the connection backlog on server sockets.
The first function is no longer needed (see below); the second function is replaced by the_backlog_ attribute.

Previously, when using a fixed thread pool task executor (which was the default), with NIO, it was possible to get a deadlock and processing would stop.
The problem occurred when a buffer was full, a thread reading from the socket was trying to add more data to the buffer, and there were no threads available to make space in the buffer.
This only occurred with a very small pool size, but it could be possible under extreme conditions.
Since 2.2, two changes have eliminated this problem.
First, the default task executor is a cached thread pool executor.
Second, deadlock detection logic has been added such that if thread starvation occurs, instead of deadlocking, an exception is thrown, thus releasing the deadlocked resources.

IMPORTANT: Now that the default task executor is unbounded, it is possible that an out of memory condition might occur with high rates of incoming messages, if message processing takes extended time.
If your application exhibits this type of behavior, you are advised to use a pooled task executor with an appropriate pool size, but see the next section.

==== Thread Pool Task Executor with CALLER_RUNS Policy

There are some important considerations when using a fixed thread pool with the `CallerRunsPolicy` (`CALLER_RUNS` when using the `<task/>` namespace) and the queue capacity is small.

The following does not apply if you are not using a fixed thread pool.

With NIO connections there are 3 distinct task types; the IO Selector processing is performed on one dedicated thread - detecting events, accepting new connections, and dispatching the IO read operations to other threads, using the task executor.
When an IO reader thread (to which the read operation is dispatched) reads data, it hands off to another thread to assemble the incoming message; large messages may take several reads to complete.
These "assembler" threads can block waiting for data.
When a new read event occurs, the reader determines if this socket already has an assembler and runs a new one if not.
When the assembly process is complete, the assembler thread is returned to the pool.

This can cause a deadlock when the pool is exhausted and the CALLER_RUNS rejection policy is in use, and the task queue is full.
When the pool is empty and there is no room in the queue, the IO selector thread receives an `OP_READ` event and dispatches the read using the executor; the queue is full, so the selector thread itself starts the read process; now, it detects that there is not an assembler for this socket and, before it does the read, fires off an assembler; again, the queue is full, and the selector thread becomes the assembler.
The assembler is now blocked awaiting the data to be read, which will never happen.
The connection factory is now deadlocked because the selector thread can't handle new events.

We must avoid the selector (or reader) threads performing the assembly task to avoid this deadlock.
It is desirable to use seperate pools for the IO and assembly operations.

The framework provides a `CompositeExecutor`, which allows the configuration of two distinct executors; one for performing IO operations, and one for message assembly.
In this environment, an IO thread can never become an assembler thread, and the deadlock cannot occur.

In addition, the task executors should be configured to use a `AbortPolicy` (ABORT when using `<task>`).
When an IO cannot be completed, it is deferred for a short time and retried continually until it can be completed and an assembler allocated.
By default, the delay is 100ms but it can be changed using the `readDelay` property on the connection factory (`read-delay` when configuring with the XML namespace).

Example configuration of the composite executor is shown below.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
private CompositeExecutor compositeExecutor() {
    ThreadPoolTaskExecutor ioExec = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    ioExec.setCorePoolSize(4);
    ioExec.setMaxPoolSize(10);

    ioExec.setThreadNamePrefix("io-");
    ioExec.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new AbortPolicy());
    ioExec.initialize();

    assemblerExec.setCorePoolSize(4);

    assemblerExec.setQueueCapacity(0);

[[ssl-tls]]
=== SSL/TLS Support

==== Overview

Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security is supported.
When using NIO, the JDK 5+ `SSLEngine` feature is used to handle handshaking after the connection is established.
When not using NIO, standard `SSLSocketFactory` and `SSLServerSocketFactory` objects are used to create connections.
A number of strategy interfaces are provided to allow significant customization; default implementations of these interfaces provide for the simplest way to get started with secure communications.

==== Getting Started

Regardless of whether NIO is being used, you need to configure the `ssl-context-support` attribute on the connection factory.
This attribute references a <bean/> definition that describes the location and passwords for the required key stores.

SSL/TLS peers require two keystores each; a keystore containing private/public key pairs identifying the peer; a truststore, containing the public keys for peers that are trusted.
See the documentation for the `keytool` utility provided with the JDK.
The essential steps are

. Create a new key pair and store in a keystore.
. Export the public key.
. Import the public key into the peer's truststore.

Repeat for the other peer.

NOTE: It is common in test cases to use the same key stores on both peers, but this should be avoided for production.

After establishing the key stores, the next step is to indicate their locations to the `TcpSSLContextSupport` bean, and provide a reference to that bean to the connection factory.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="sslContextSupport"
    class="o.sf.integration.ip.tcp.connection.support.DefaultTcpSSLContextSupport">
    <constructor-arg value="client.ks"/>
    <constructor-arg value="client.truststore.ks"/>
    <constructor-arg value="secret"/>
    <constructor-arg value="secret"/>
</bean>

<ip:tcp-connection-factory id="clientFactory"
    type="client"
    host="localhost"
    port="1234"
    ssl-context-support="sslContextSupport"
----

The `DefaulTcpSSLContextSupport` class also has an optional 'protocol' property, which can be 'SSL' or 'TLS' (default).

The keystore file names (first two constructor arguments) use the Spring `Resource` abstraction; by default the files will be located on the classpath, but this can be overridden by using the `file:` prefix, to find the files on the filesystem instead.

==== Advanced Techniques

In many cases, the configuration described above is all that is needed to enable secure communication over TCP/IP.
However, a number of strategy interfaces are provided to allow customization and modification of socket factories and sockets.

* `TcpSSLContextSupport`
* `TcpSocketFactorySupport`
* `TcpSocketSupport`

[source,java]
----
public interface TcpSSLContextSupport {

	SSLContext getSSLContext() throws Exception;

}
----

Implementations of this interface are responsible for creating an SSLContext.
The sole implementation provided by the framework is the `DefaultTcpSSLContextSupport` described above.
If you require different behavior, implement this interface and provide the connection factory with a reference to a bean of your class' implementation.

[source,java]
----
public interface TcpSocketFactorySupport {

    ServerSocketFactory getServerSocketFactory();

    SocketFactory getSocketFactory();

}

----

Implementations of this interface are responsible for obtaining references to `ServerSocketFactory` and `SocketFactory`.
Two implementations are provided; the first is `DefaultTcpNetSocketFactorySupport` for non-SSL sockets (when no 'ssl-context-support' attribute is defined); this simply uses the JDK's default factories.
The second implementation is `DefaultTcpNetSSLSocketFactorySupport`; this is used, by default, when an 'ssl-context-support' attribute is defined; it uses the `SSLContext` created by that bean to create the socket factories.

NOTE: This interface only applies if `using-nio` is "false"; socket factories are not used by NIO.

[source,java]
----
public interface TcpSocketSupport {

    void postProcessServerSocket(ServerSocket serverSocket);

    void postProcessSocket(Socket socket);


----

Implementations of this interface can modify sockets after they are created, and after all configured attributes have been applied, but before the sockets are used.
This applies whether or not NIO is being used.
For example, you could use an implementation of this interface to modify the supported cipher suites on an SSL socket, or you could add a listener that gets notified after SSL handshaking is complete.
The sole implementation provided by the framework is the `DefaultTcpSocketSupport` which does not modify the sockets in any way

To supply your own implementation of `TcpSocketFactorySupport` or `TcpSocketSupport`, provide the connection factory with references to beans of your custom type using the `socket-factory-support` and `socket-support` attributes, respectively.

| reply-channel
|
| Optional.
The channel to which reply messages may be sent.
| remote-timeout
|
| The time in milliseconds for which the gateway will wait for a reply from the remote system.
Mutually exclusive with `remote-timeout-expression`.
Default: 10000 (10 seconds).
Note: in versions prior to _4.2_ this value defaulted to `reply-timeout` (if set).
| remote-timeout-expression
|
| A SpEL expression, evaluated against the message to determine the time in milliseconds for which the gateway will wait for a reply from the remote system.
Mutually exclusive with `remote-timeout`.
| request-timeout
|
| If a single-use connection factory is not being used, The time in milliseconds for which the gateway will wait to get access to the shared connection.
| reply-timeout
|
| The time in milliseconds for which the gateway will wait when sending the reply to the reply-channel.
Only applies if the reply-channel might block, such as a bounded QueueChannel that is currently full.

.IP Message Headers
[[ip-msg-headers]]
=== IP Message Headers
The following `MessageHeader` s are used by this module:
[cols="2,2,4", options="header"]
|===
| Header Name
| IpHeaders Constant
| Description
| ip_hostname
| HOSTNAME
| The host name from which a TCP message or UDP packet was received.
If `lookupHost` is `false`, this will contain the ip address.
| ip_address
| IP_ADDRESS
| The ip address from which a TCP message or UDP packet was received.
| ip_port
| PORT
| The remote port for a UDP packet.
| ip_ackTo
| ACKADDRESS
| The remote ip address to which UDP application-level acks will be sent.
The framework includes acknowledgment information in the data packet.
| ip_ackId
| ACK_ID
| A correlation id for UDP application-level acks.
The framework includes acknowledgment information in the data packet.
| ip_tcp_remotePort
| REMOTE_PORT
| The remote port for a TCP connection.
| ip_connectionId
| CONNECTION_ID
| A unique identifier for a TCP connection; set by the framework for inbound messages; when sending to a server-side inbound channel adapter, or replying to an inbound gateway, this header is required so the endpoint can determine which connection to send the message to.
| ip_actualConnectionId
| ACTUAL_ CONNECTION_ID
| For information only - when using a cached or failover client connection factory, contains the actual underlying connection id.
|===

For inbound messages, `ip_hostname`, `ip_address`, `ip_tcp_remotePort` and `ip_connectionId` are mapped by the default
`TcpHeaderMapper`.
Users can add additional headers by subclassing `TcpHeaderMapper`, overriding the method `supplyCustomHeaders`, and
providing an instance to the connection factory using the `mapper` property.
For example, when using SSL, properties of the `SSLSession` can be added by obtaining the session object from the
`TcpConnection` object which is provided as an argument to the `supplyCustomHeaders` method.

[[ip-annotation]]
=== Annotation-Based Configuration

The following example from the samples respository is used to illustrate some of the configuration options when using
annotations instead of XML.

[source, java]
----
@EnableIntegration <1>
@IntegrationComponentScan <2>
@Configuration
public static class Config {

    @Value(${some.port})
    private int port;

    @MessagingGateway(defaultRequestChannel="toTcp") <3>
    public interface Gateway {

        String viaTcp(String in);

    }

    @Bean
    @ServiceActivator(inputChannel="toTcp") <4>
    public MessageHandler tcpOutGate(AbstractClientConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        TcpOutboundGateway gate = new TcpOutboundGateway();
        gate.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        gate.setOutputChannelName("resultToString");
        return gate;
    }

    @Bean <5>
    public TcpInboundGateway tcpInGate(AbstractServerConnectionFactory connectionFactory)  {
        TcpInboundGateway inGate = new TcpInboundGateway();
        inGate.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        inGate.setRequestChannel(fromTcp());
        return inGate;
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel fromTcp() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @MessageEndpoint
    public static class Echo { <6>

        @Transformer(inputChannel="fromTcp", outputChannel="toEcho")
        public String convert(byte[] bytes) {
            return new String(bytes);
        }

        @ServiceActivator(inputChannel="toEcho")
        public String upCase(String in) {
            return in.toUpperCase();
        }

        @Transformer(inputChannel="resultToString")
        public String convertResult(byte[] bytes) {
            return new String(bytes);
        }

    }

    @Bean
    public AbstractClientConnectionFactory clientCF() { <7>
        return new TcpNetClientConnectionFactory("localhost", this.port);
    }

    @Bean
    public AbstractServerConnectionFactory serverCF() { <8>
        return new TcpNetServerConnectionFactory(this.port);
    }

}
----

<1> Standard Spring Integration annotation enabling the infrastructure for an integration application.

<2> Searches for `@MessagingGateway` interfaces.

<3> The entry point to the client-side of the flow. The calling application can `@Autowired` this `Gateway` bean
and invoke its method.

<4> Outbound endpoints consist of a `MessageHandler` and a consumer that wraps it. In this scenario, the
`@ServiceActivator` configures the endpoint according to the channel type.

<5> Inbound endpoints (in the TCP/UDP module) are all message-driven so just need to be declared as simple `@Bean` s.

<6> This class provides a number of POJO methods for use in this sample flow (a `@Transformer` and `@ServiceActivator`
on the server side, and a `@Transformer` on the client side).

<7> The client-side connection factory.

<8> The server-side connection factory.

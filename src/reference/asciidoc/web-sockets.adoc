== WebSockets Support

[[web-socket-introduction]]
=== Introduction

Starting with _version 4.1_ Spring Integration has introduced _WebSocket_ support.
It is based on architecture, infrastructure and API from the Spring Framework's _web-socket_ module.
Therefore, many of Spring WebSocket's components (e.g.
`SubProtocolHandler` or `WebSocketClient`) and configuration options (e.g.
`@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker`) can be reused within Spring Integration.
For more information, please, refer to the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/#websocket[Spring Framework WebSocket Support] chapter in the Spring Framework reference manual.

NOTE: Since the Spring Framework WebSocket infrastructure is based on the _Spring Messaging_ foundation and provides a basic Messaging framework based on the same `MessageChannel` s, `MessageHandler` s that Spring Integration uses, and some POJO-method annotation mappings, Spring Integration can be directly involved in a WebSocket flow, even without WebSocket adapters.
For this purpose you can simply configure a Spring Integration `@MessagingGateway` with appropriate annotations:

[source,java]
----
@MessagingGateway
@Controller
public interface WebSocketGateway {

    @MessageMapping("/greeting")
    @SendToUser("/queue/answer")
    @Gateway(requestChannel = "greetingChannel")
    String greeting(String payload);

}

[[web-socket-overview]]
=== Overview

Since the WebSocket protocol is _streaming_ by definition and we can _send_ and _receive_ messages to/from a WebSocket at the same time, we can simply deal with an appropriate `WebSocketSession`, regardless of being on the client or server side.
To encapsulate the connection management and `WebSocketSession` registry, the `IntegrationWebSocketContainer` is provided with `ClientWebSocketContainer` and `ServerWebSocketContainer` implementations.
Thanks to the https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[WebSocket API] and its implementation in the Spring Framework, with many extensions, the same classes are used on the server side as well as the client side (from a Java perspective, of course).
Hence most connection and `WebSocketSession` registry options are the same on both sides.
That allows us to reuse many configuration items and infrastructure hooks to build WebSocket applications on the server side as well as on the client side:
[source,java]
----
//Client side
@Bean
public WebSocketClient webSocketClient() {
	return new SockJsClient(Collections.<Transport>singletonList(new WebSocketTransport(new JettyWebSocketClient())));
}

@Bean
public IntegrationWebSocketContainer clientWebSocketContainer() {
	return new ClientWebSocketContainer(webSocketClient(), "ws://my.server.com/endpoint");
}

//Server side
@Bean
public IntegrationWebSocketContainer serverWebSocketContainer() {
	return new ServerWebSocketContainer("/endpoint").withSockJs();
}
----

The `IntegrationWebSocketContainer` is designed to achieve _bidirectional_ messaging and can be shared between Inbound and Outbound Channel Adapters (see below), can be referenced only from one of them (when using one-way - sending or receiving - WebSocket messaging).
It can be used without any Channel Adapter, but in this case, `IntegrationWebSocketContainer` only plays a role as the `WebSocketSession` registry.

NOTE: The `ServerWebSocketContainer` implements `WebSocketConfigurer` to register an internal `IntegrationWebSocketContainer.IntegrationWebSocketHandler` as an `Endpoint` under the provided `paths` and other server WebSocket options (such as `HandshakeHandler` or `SockJS fallback`) within the `ServletWebSocketHandlerRegistry` for the target vendor WebSocket Container.
This registration is achieved with an infrastructural `WebSocketIntegrationConfigurationInitializer` component, which does the same as the `@EnableWebSocket` annotation.
This means that using just `@EnableIntegration` (or any Spring Integration Namespace in the application context) you can omit the `@EnableWebSocket` declaration, because all WebSocket Endpoints are detected by the Spring Integration infrastructure.

[[web-socket-inbound-adapter]]
=== WebSocket Inbound Channel Adapter

The `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` implements the receiving part of `WebSocketSession` interaction.
It must be supplied with a `IntegrationWebSocketContainer`, and the adapter registers itself as a `WebSocketListener` to handle incoming messages and `WebSocketSession` events.

NOTE: Only one `WebSocketListener` can be registered in the `IntegrationWebSocketContainer`.

For WebSocket _sub-protocol_s, the `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` can be configured with `SubProtocolHandlerRegistry` as the second constructor argument.
The adapter delegates to the `SubProtocolHandlerRegistry` to determine the appropriate `SubProtocolHandler` for the accepted `WebSocketSession` and to convert `WebSocketMessage` to a `Message` according to the sub-protocol implementation.

NOTE: By default, the `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` relies just only on the raw `PassThruSubProtocolHandler` implementation, which simply converts the `WebSocketMessage` to a `Message`.

The `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` accepts and sends to the underlying integration flow only `Message` s with `SimpMessageType.MESSAGE` or an empty `simpMessageType` header.
All other `Message` types are handled through the `ApplicationEvent` s emitted from a `SubProtocolHandler` implementation (e.g.
`StompSubProtocolHandler`).

On the server side `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` can be configured with the `useBroker = true` option, if the `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker` configuration is present.
In this case all `non-MESSAGE` `Message` types are delegated to the provided `AbstractBrokerMessageHandler`.
In addition, if the Broker Relay is configured with destination prefixes, those Messages, which match to the Broker destinations, are routed to the `AbstractBrokerMessageHandler`, instead of to the `outputChannel` of the `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter`.

If `useBroker = false` and received message is of `SimpMessageType.CONNECT` type, the `WebSocketInboundChannelAdapter` sends `SimpMessageType.CONNECT_ACK` message to the `WebSocketSession` immediately without sending it to the channel.

NOTE: Spring's WebSocket Support allows the configuration of only one Broker Relay, hence we don't require an `AbstractBrokerMessageHandler` reference, it is detected in the Application Context.

For more configuration options see <<web-sockets-namespace>>.

[[web-socket-outbound-adapter]]
=== WebSocket Outbound Channel Adapter

The `WebSocketOutboundChannelAdapter` accepts Spring Integration messages from its `MessageChannel`, determines the `WebSocketSession` `id` from the `MessageHeaders`, retrieves the `WebSocketSession` from the provided `IntegrationWebSocketContainer` and delegates the conversion and sending `WebSocketMessage` work to the appropriate `SubProtocolHandler` from the provided `SubProtocolHandlerRegistry`.

On the client side, the `WebSocketSession` `id` message header isn't required, because `ClientWebSocketContainer` deals only with a single connection and its `WebSocketSession` respectively.

To use the STOMP sub-protocol, this adapter should be configured with a `StompSubProtocolHandler`.
Then you can send any STOMP message type to this adapter, using `StompHeaderAccessor.create(StompCommand...)` and a `MessageBuilder`, or just using a `HeaderEnricher` (see <<header-enricher>>).

For more configuration options see below.

[[web-sockets-namespace]]
=== WebSockets Namespace Support

Spring Integration _WebSocket_ namespace includes several components described below.
To include it in your configuration, simply provide the following namespace declaration in your application context configuration file:

----

<1> The component bean name.


<2> The `WebSocketClient` bean reference.


<3> The `uri` or `uriTemplate` to the target WebSocket service.
If it is used as a `uriTemplate` with URI variable placeholders, the `uri-variables` attribute is required.


<4> Comma-separated values for the URI variable placeholders within the `uri` attribute value.
The values are replaced into the placeholders according to the order in the `uri`.
See `UriComponents.expand(Object...
uriVariableValues)`.


<5> The `Origin` Handshake HTTP header value.


<6> The WebSocket session 'send' timeout limit.
Defaults to `10000`.


<7> The WebSocket session 'send' message size limit.
Defaults to `524288`.


<8> Boolean value indicating whether this endpoint should start automatically.
Defaults to `false`, assuming that this container will be started from the <<web-socket-inbound-adapter>>.


<9> The lifecycle phase within which this endpoint should start and stop.
The lower the value the earlier this endpoint will start and the later it will stop.
The default is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
Values can be negative.
See `SmartLifeCycle`.

----

<1> The component bean name.


<2> A path (or comma-separated paths) that maps a particular request to a `WebSocketHandler`.
Exact path mapping URIs (such as `"/myPath"`) are supported as well as ant-style path patterns (such as `/myPath/**`).


<3> The `HandshakeHandler` bean reference.
Default to `DefaultHandshakeHandler`.


<4> List of `HandshakeInterceptor` bean references.


<5> Configure one or more factories (`WebSocketHandlerDecoratorFactory`) to decorate the handler
used to process WebSocket messages.
This may be useful for some advanced use cases, for example to allow Spring Security to forcibly close
the WebSocket session when the corresponding HTTP session expires.
See http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current/reference/html5/#websocket[Spring Session Project]
for more information.

<6> See the same option on the `<int-websocket:client-container>`.


<7> See the same option on the `<int-websocket:client-container>`.


<8> Transports with no native cross-domain communication (e.g.
"eventsource", "htmlfile") must get a simple page from the "foreign" domain in an invisible iframe so that code in the iframe can run from a domain local to the SockJS server.
Since the iframe needs to load the SockJS javascript client library, this property allows specifying where to load it from.
By default this is set to point to `https://d1fxtkz8shb9d2.cloudfront.net/sockjs-0.3.4.min.js`.
However it can also be set to point to a URL served by the application.
Note that it's possible to specify a relative URL in which case the URL must be relative to the iframe URL.
For example assuming a SockJS endpoint mapped to "/sockjs", and resulting iframe URL "/sockjs/iframe.html", then the The relative URL must start with "../../" to traverse up to the location above the SockJS mapping.
In case of a prefix-based Servlet mapping one more traversal may be needed.


<9> Minimum number of bytes that can be send over a single HTTP streaming request before it will be closed.
Defaults to `128K` (i.e.
128*1024 bytes).


<10> The "cookie_needed" value in the response from the SockJs `"/info"` endpoint.
This property indicates whether the use of a JSESSIONID cookie is required for the application to function correctly, e.g.
for load balancing or in Java Servlet containers for the use of an HTTP session.


<11> The amount of time in milliseconds when the server has not sent any messages and after which the server should
send a heartbeat frame to the client in order to keep the connection from breaking.
The default value is `25,000` (25 seconds).


<12> The amount of time in milliseconds before a client is considered disconnected after not having a receiving
connection, i.e.
an active connection over which the server can send data to the client.
The default value is `5000`.


<13> The number of server-to-client messages that a session can cache while waiting for the next HTTP polling request
 from the client.
The default size is `100`.


<14> Some load balancers don't support websockets.
Set this option to `false` to disable the WebSocket transport on the server side.
The default value is `true`.


<15> The `TaskScheduler` bean reference; a new `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` instance will be created if no value is
provided.
This scheduler instance will be used for scheduling heart-beat messages.


<16> The `SockJsMessageCodec` bean reference to use for encoding and decoding SockJS messages.
By default `Jackson2SockJsMessageCodec` is used requiring the Jackson library to be present on the classpath.


<17> List of `TransportHandler` bean references.

=== Logging Channel Adapter

The `<logging-channel-adapter/>` is often used in conjunction with a Wire Tap, as discussed in<<channel-wiretap>>.
However, it can also be used as the ultimate consumer of any flow.
For example, consider a flow that ends with a `<service-activator/>` that returns a result, but you wish to discard that result.
To do that, you could send the result to `NullChannel`.
Alternatively, you can route it to an `INFO` level `<logging-channel-adapter/>`; that way, you can see the discarded message when logging at `INFO` level, but not see it when logging at, say, `WARN` level.
With a `NullChannel`, you would only see the discarded message when logging at `DEBUG` level.

----

<1> The channel connecting the logging adapter to an upstream component.


<2> The logging level at which messages sent to this adapter will be logged.
Default: `INFO`.


<3> A SpEL expression representing exactly what part(s) of the message will be logged.
Default: `payload` - just the payload will be logged.
This attribute cannot be specified if `log-full-message` is specified.


<4> When `true`, the entire message will be logged (including headers).
Default: `false` - just the payload will be logged.
This attribute cannot be specified if `expression` is specified.


<5> Specifies the _name_ of the logger (known as `category` in `log4j`) used for log messages created by this adapter.
This enables setting the log name (in the logging subsystem) for individual adapters.
By default, all adapters will log under the name `org.springframework.integration.handler.LoggingHandler`.

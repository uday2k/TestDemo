== JDBC Support

Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and sending messages via database queries.
Through those adapters Spring Integration supports not only plain JDBC SQL Queries, but also Stored Procedure and Stored Function calls.

The following JDBC components are available by default:

* _<<jdbc-inbound-channel-adapter,Inbound Channel Adapter>>_
* _<<jdbc-outbound-channel-adapter,Outbound Channel Adapter>>_
* _<<jdbc-outbound-gateway,Outbound Gateway>>_
* _<<stored-procedure-inbound-channel-adapter,Stored Procedure Inbound Channel Adapter>>_
* _<<stored-procedure-outbound-channel-adapter,Stored Procedure Outbound Channel Adapter>>_
* _<<stored-procedure-outbound-gateway,Stored Procedure Outbound Gateway>>_



Furthermore, the Spring Integration JDBC Module also provides a _<<jdbc-message-store,JDBC Message Store>>_

[[jdbc-inbound-channel-adapter]]
=== Inbound Channel Adapter

The main function of an inbound Channel Adapter is to execute a SQL `SELECT` query and turn the result set as a message.
The message payload is the whole result set, expressed as a `List`, and the types of the items in the list depend on the row-mapping strategy that is used.
The default strategy is a generic mapper that just returns a `Map` for each row in the query result.
Optionally, this can be changed by adding a reference to a `RowMapper` instance (see the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html[Spring JDBC] documentation for more detailed information about row mapping).

NOTE: If you want to convert rows in the SELECT query result to individual messages you can use a downstream splitter.

The inbound adapter also requires a reference to either a `JdbcTemplate` instance or a `DataSource`.

As well as the `SELECT` statement to generate the messages, the adapter above also has an `UPDATE` statement that is being used to mark the records as processed so that they don't show up in the next poll.
The update can be parameterized by the list of ids from the original select.
This is done through a naming convention by default (a column in the input result set called "id" is translated into a list in the parameter map for the update called "id").
The following example defines an inbound Channel Adapter with an update query and a `DataSource` reference.
[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter query="select * from item where status=2"
    channel="target" data-source="dataSource"
    update="update item set status=10 where id in (:id)" />
----

NOTE: The parameters in the update query are specified with a colon (:) prefix to the name of a parameter (which in this case is an expression to be applied to each of the rows in the polled result set).
This is a standard feature of the named parameter JDBC support in Spring JDBC combined with a convention (projection onto the polled result list) adopted in Spring Integration.
The underlying Spring JDBC features limit the available expressions (e.g.
most special characters other than period are disallowed), but since the target is usually a list of or an individual object addressable by simple bean paths this isn't unduly restrictive.

To change the parameter generation strategy you can inject a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` into the adapter to override the default behavior (the adapter has a `sql-parameter-source-factory` attribute).
Spring Integration provides a `ExpressionEvaluatingSqlParameterSourceFactory` which will create a SpEL-based parameter source, with the results of the query as the`#root` object.
(If `update-per-row` is true, the root object is the row).
If the same parameter name appears multiple times in the update query, it is evaluated only one time, and its result is cached.

You can also use a parameter source for the select query.
In this case, since there is no "result" object to evaluate against, a single parameter source is used each time (rather than using a parameter source factory).
Starting with _version 4.0_, you can use Spring to create a SpEL based parameter source as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter query="select * from item where status=:status"
	channel="target" data-source="dataSource"
	select-sql-parameter-source="parameterSource" />

<bean id="parameterSource" factory-bean="parameterSourceFactory"
			factory-method="createParameterSourceNoCache">
	<constructor-arg value="" />
</bean>

<bean id="parameterSourceFactory"
		class="o.s.integration.jdbc.ExpressionEvaluatingSqlParameterSourceFactory">
	<property name="parameterExpressions">
		<map>
			<entry key="status" value="@statusBean.which()" />
		</map>
	</property>
</bean>

<bean id="statusBean" class="foo.StatusDetermination" />
----

The `value` in each parameter expression can be any valid SpEL expression.
The `#root` object for the expression evaluation is the constructor argument defined on the `parameterSource` bean.
It is static for all evaluations (in this case, an empty String).

IMPORTANT: Use the `createParameterSourceNoCache` factory method; otherwise the parameter source will cache the result of the evaluation.
Also note that, because caching is disabled, if the same parameter name appears in the select query multiple times, it will be re-evaluated for each occurrence.

==== Polling and Transactions

The inbound adapter accepts a regular Spring Integration poller as a sub element, so for instance the frequency of the polling can be controlled.
A very important feature of the poller for JDBC usage is the option to wrap the poll operation in a transaction, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter query="..."
        channel="target" data-source="dataSource" update="...">
    <int:poller fixed-rate="1000">
        <int:transactional/>
    </int:poller>
</int-jdbc:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

NOTE: If a poller is not explicitly specified, a default value will be used (and as per normal with Spring Integration can be defined as a top level bean).

In this example the database is polled every 1000 milliseconds, and the update and select queries are both executed in the same transaction.
The transaction manager configuration is not shown, but as long as it is aware of the data source then the poll is transactional.
A common use case is for the downstream channels to be direct channels (the default), so that the endpoints are invoked in the same thread, and hence the same transaction.
Then if any of them fail, the transaction rolls back and the input data is reverted to its original state.

[[jdbc-max-rows-per-poll-versus-max-messages-per-poll]]
==== Max-rows-per-poll versus Max-messages-per-poll

The _JDBC Inbound Channel Adapter_ defines an attribute _max-rows-per-poll_.
When you specify the adapter's _Poller_, you can also define a property called _max-messages-per-poll_.
While these two attributes look similar, their meaning is quite different.

_max-messages-per-poll_ specifies the number of times the query is executed per polling interval, whereas _max-rows-per-poll_ specifies the number of rows returned for each execution.

Under normal circumstances, you would likely not want to set the Poller's _max-messages-per-poll_ property when using the _JDBC Inbound Channel Adapter_.
Its default value is _1_, which means that the _JDBC
			Inbound Channel Adapter's http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/jdbc/JdbcPollingChannelAdapter.html#receive()[receive()]_ method is executed exactly once for each poll interval.

Setting the _max-messages-per-poll_ attribute to a larger value means that the query is executed that many times back to back.
For more information regarding the _max-messages-per-poll_ attribute, please see <<channel-adapter-namespace-inbound>>.

In contrast, the _max-rows-per-poll_ attribute, if greater than _0_, specifies the maximum number of rows that will be used from the query result set, per execution of the _receive()_ method.
If the attribute is set to _0_, then all rows will be included in the resulting message.
If not explicitly set, the attribute defaults to _0_.

[[jdbc-outbound-channel-adapter]]
=== Outbound Channel Adapter

The outbound Channel Adapter is the inverse of the inbound: its role is to handle a message and use it to execute a SQL query.
The message payload and headers are available by default as input parameters to the query, for instance:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter
    query="insert into foos (id, status, name) values (:headers[id], 0, :payload[foo])"
    data-source="dataSource"
    channel="input"/>
----

In the example above, messages arriving on the channel labelled _input_ have a payload of a map with key _foo_, so the `[]` operator dereferences that value from the map.
The headers are also accessed as a map.

NOTE: The parameters in the query above are bean property expressions on the incoming message (not Spring EL expressions).
This behavior is part of the `SqlParameterSource` which is the default source created by the outbound adapter.
Other behavior is possible in the adapter, and requires the user to inject a different `SqlParameterSourceFactory`.

The outbound adapter requires a reference to either a `DataSource` or a `JdbcTemplate`.
It can also have a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` injected to control the binding of each incoming message to a query.

If the input channel is a direct channel, then the outbound adapter runs its query in the same thread, and therefore the same transaction (if there is one) as the sender of the message.

_Passing Parameters using SpEL Expressions_

A common requirement for most JDBC Channel Adapters is to pass parameters as part of Sql queries or Stored Procedures/Functions.
As mentioned above, these parameters are by default bean property expressions, not SpEL expressions.
However, if you need to pass SpEL expression as parameters, you must inject a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` explicitly.

The following example uses a `ExpressionEvaluatingSqlParameterSourceFactory` to achieve that requirement.

[source,xml]
----
<jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter data-source="dataSource" channel="input"
    query="insert into MESSAGES (MESSAGE_ID,PAYLOAD,CREATED_DATE)     \
    values (:id, :payload, :createdDate)"
    sql-parameter-source-factory="spelSource"/>

<bean id="spelSource"
      class="o.s.integration.jdbc.ExpressionEvaluatingSqlParameterSourceFactory">
    <property name="parameterExpressions">
        <map>
            <entry key="id"          value="headers['id'].toString()"/>
            <entry key="createdDate" value="new java.util.Date()"/>
            <entry key="payload"     value="payload"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>
----

For further information, please also see <<sp-defining-parameter-sources>>

_PreparedStatement Callback_

There are some cases when the flexibility and loose-coupling of `SqlParameterSourceFactory` isn't enough for the target
`PreparedStatement` or we need to do some low-level JDBC work.
The Spring JDBC module provides APIs to configure the execution environment (e.g. `ConnectionCallback`
or `PreparedStatementCreator`) and manipulation of parameter values (e.g. `SqlParameterSource`).
Or even APIs for low level operations, for example `StatementCallback`.

Starting with _Spring Integration 4.2_, the `MessagePreparedStatementSetter` is available to allow
the specification of parameters on the `PreparedStatement` manually, in the `requestMessage` context.
This class plays exactly the same role as `PreparedStatementSetter` in the standard Spring JDBC API.
Actually it is invoked directly from an inline `PreparedStatementSetter` implementation, when the `JdbcMessageHandler`
invokes `execute` on the `JdbcTemplate`.

This functional interface option is mutually exclusive with `sqlParameterSourceFactory` and can be used as a more
powerful alternative to populate parameters of the `PreparedStatement` from the `requestMessage`.
For example it is useful when we need to store `File` data to the DataBase `BLOB` column in a stream manner:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "storeFileChannel")
public MessageHandler jdbcMessageHandler(DataSource dataSource) {
    JdbcMessageHandler jdbcMessageHandler = new JdbcMessageHandler(dataSource,
    		"INSERT INTO imagedb (image_name, content, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
    jdbcMessageHandler.setPreparedStatementSetter((ps, m) -> {
    	ps.setString(1, m.getHeaders().get(FileHeaders.FILENAME));
    	try (FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream((File) m.getPayload())) {
    		ps.setBlob(2, inputStream);
    	}
    	catch (Exception e) {
    		throw new MessageHandlingException(m, e);
    	}
    	ps.setClob(3, new StringReader(m.getHeaders().get("description", String.class)));
    });
    return jdbcMessageHandler;
}
----

From the XML configuration perspective, the `prepared-statement-setter` attribute is available on the
`<int-jdbc:outbound-channel-adapter>` component, to specify a  `MessagePreparedStatementSetter`
bean reference.

[[jdbc-outbound-gateway]]
=== Outbound Gateway

The outbound Gateway is like a combination of the outbound and inbound adapters: its role is to handle a message and use it to execute a SQL query and then respond with the result sending it to a reply channel.
The message payload and headers are available by default as input parameters to the query, for instance:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into foos (id, status, name) values (:headers[id], 0, :payload[foo])"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource" />
----

The result of the above would be to insert a record into the "foos" table and return a message to the output channel indicating the number of rows affected (the payload is a map: `{UPDATED=1}`).

If the update query is an insert with auto-generated keys, the reply message can be populated with the generated keys by adding `keys-generated="true"` to the above example (this is not the default because it is not supported by some database platforms).
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into foos (status, name) values (0, :payload[foo])"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource"
    keys-generated="true"/>
----

Instead of the update count or the generated keys, you can also provide a select query to execute and generate a reply message from the result (like the inbound adapter), e.g:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    update="insert into foos (id, status, name) values (:headers[id], 0, :payload[foo])"
    query="select * from foos where id=:headers[$id]"
    request-channel="input" reply-channel="output" data-source="dataSource"/>
----

Since _Spring Integration 2.2_ the update SQL query is no longer mandatory.
You can now solely provide a select query, using either the _query attribute_ or the _query sub-element_.
This is extremely useful if you need to actively retrieve data using e.g.
a generic Gateway or a Payload Enricher.
The reply message is then generated from the result, like the inbound adapter, and passed to the reply channel.

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway
    query="select * from foos where id=:headers[id]"
    request-channel="input"
    reply-channel="output"
    data-source="dataSource"/>
----

As with the channel adapters, there is also the option to provide `SqlParameterSourceFactory` instances for request and reply.
The default is the same as for the outbound adapter, so the request message is available as the root of an expression.
If keys-generated="true" then the root of the expression is the generated keys (a map if there is only one or a list of maps if multi-valued).

The outbound gateway requires a reference to either a DataSource or a JdbcTemplate.
It can also have a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` injected to control the binding of the incoming message to the query.

Starting with the _version 4.2_ the `request-prepared-statement-setter` attribute is available on the
`<int-jdbc:outbound-gateway>` as an alternative to the `request-sql-parameter-source-factory`.
It allows you to specify a `MessagePreparedStatementSetter` bean reference, which implements more sophisticated
`PreparedStatement` preparation before its execution.

See <<jdbc-outbound-channel-adapter>> for more information about `MessagePreparedStatementSetter`.

[[jdbc-message-store]]
=== JDBC Message Store

Spring Integration provides 2 JDBC specific Message Store implementations.
The first one, is the `JdbcMessageStore` which is suitable to be used in conjunction with _Aggregators_ and the
_Claim-Check_ pattern.
While it can be used for backing _Message Channels_ as well, you may want to consider using the `JdbcChannelMessageStore` implementation instead, as it provides a more targeted and scalable implementation.

[[jdbc-message-store-generic]]
==== The Generic JDBC Message Store

The JDBC module provides an implementation of the Spring Integration `MessageStore` (important in the Claim Check pattern) and `MessageGroupStore` (important in stateful patterns like Aggregator) backed by a database.
Both interfaces are implemented by the `JdbcMessageStore`, and there is also support for configuring store instances in XML.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:message-store id="messageStore" data-source="dataSource"/>

----

A `JdbcTemplate` can be specified instead of a `DataSource`.

Other optional attributes are show in the next example:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:message-store id="messageStore" data-source="dataSource"
    lob-handler="lobHandler" table-prefix="MY_INT_"/>
----

Here we have specified a `LobHandler` for dealing with messages as large objects (e.g.
often necessary if using Oracle) and a prefix for the table names in the queries generated by the store.
The table name prefix defaults to "INT_".

[NOTE]
=====
If you plan on using *MySQL*, please use MySQL version _5.6.4_ or higher, if possible.
Prior versions do not support _fractional seconds_ for temporal data types.
Because of that, messages may not arrive in the precise FIFO order when polling from such a MySQL Message Store.

Therefore, starting with _Spring Integration 3.0_, we provide an additional set of DDL scripts for MySQL version_5.6.4_ or higher:

* schema-drop-mysql-5_6_4.sql
* schema-mysql-5_6_4.sql

For more information, please see: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/fractional-seconds.html[Fractional Seconds in Time Values].

Also important, please ensure that you use an up-to-date version of the JDBC driver for MySQL (Connector/J), e.g.
version_5.1.24_ or higher.
=====

[[jdbc-message-store-channels]]
==== Backing Message Channels

If you intend backing _Message Channels_ using JDBC, it is recommended to use the provided `JdbcChannelMessageStore` implementation instead.
It can only be used in conjunction with _Message Channels_.

*Supported Databases*

The `JdbcChannelMessageStore` uses database specific SQL queries to retrieve messages from the database.
Therefore, users must set the `ChannelMessageStoreQueryProvider` property on the `JdbcChannelMessageStore`.
This `channelMessageStoreQueryProvider` provides the SQL queries and Spring Integration provides support for the following relational databases:

* PostgreSQL
* HSQLDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Derby



If your database is not listed, you can easily extend the `AbstractChannelMessageStoreQueryProvider` class and provide your own custom queries.

Since _version 4.0_, the `MESSAGE_SEQUENCE` column has been added to the table to ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing even when messages are stored in the same millisecond.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Generally it is not recommended to use a relational database for the purpose of queuing.
Instead, if possible, consider using either JMS or AMQP backed channels instead.
For further reference please see the following resources:


* https://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you/[5 subtle ways you’re using MySQL as a queue, and why it’ll bite you].
* http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2012/04/database-as-queue-anti-pattern.html[The Database As Queue Anti-Pattern].
=====

*Concurrent Polling*

When polling a _Message Channel_, you have the option to configure the associated `Poller` with a `TaskExecutor` reference.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Keep in mind, though, that if you use a JDBC backed _Message Channel_ and you are planning on polling the channel and consequently the message store transactionally with multiple threads, you should ensure that you use a relational database that supportshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control[Multiversion Concurrency Control] (MVCC).
Otherwise, locking may be an issue and the performance, when using multiple threads, may not materialize as expected.
For example Apache Derby is problematic in that regard.

To achieve better JDBC queue throughput, and avoid issues when different threads may poll the same `Message` from the queue, it is *important* to set the `usingIdCache` property of `JdbcChannelMessageStore` to `true` when using databases that do not support MVCC:
=====

[source,xml]
----
…
<bean id="queryProvider"
    class="o.s.i.jdbc.store.channel.PostgresChannelMessageStoreQueryProvider"/>

<int:transaction-synchronization-factory id="syncFactory">
    <int:after-commit expression="@store.removeFromIdCache(headers.id.toString())" />
    <int:after-rollback expression="@store.removeFromIdCache(headers.id.toString())"/>
</int:transaction-synchronization-factory>

<task:executor id="pool" pool-size="10"
    queue-capacity="10" rejection-policy="CALLER_RUNS" />

    <property name="usingIdCache" value="true"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="inputChannel">
    <int:queue message-store="store"/>
</int:channel>

<int:bridge input-channel="inputChannel" output-channel="outputChannel">

        <int:transactional propagation="REQUIRED" synchronization-factory="syncFactory"
        isolation="READ_COMMITTED" transaction-manager="transactionManager" />
    </int:poller>
</int:bridge>

<int:channel id="outputChannel" />
…
----

*Priority Channel*

Starting with _version 4.0_, the `JdbcChannelMessageStore` implements `PriorityCapableChannelMessageStore` and provides the `priorityEnabled` option allowing it to be used as a `message-store` reference for `priority-queue` s.
For this purpose, the `INT_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` has a `MESSAGE_PRIORITY` column to store the value of `PRIORITY` Message header.
In addition, a new `MESSAGE_SEQUENCE` column is also provided to achieve a robust first-in-first-out (FIFO) polling mechanism, even when multiple messages are stored with the same priority in the same millisecond.
Messages are polled (selected) from the database with `order by MESSAGE_PRIORITY DESC NULLS LAST, CREATED_DATE, MESSAGE_SEQUENCE`.

NOTE: It's not recommended to use the same `JdbcChannelMessageStore` bean for priority and non-priority queue channel, because `priorityEnabled` option applies to the entire store and proper FIFO queue semantics will not be retained for the queue channel.
However the same `INT_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` table, and even `region`, can be used for both `JdbcChannelMessageStore` types.
To configure that scenario, simply extend one message store bean from the other:


[source,xml]
----
<bean id="channelStore" class="o.s.i.jdbc.store.JdbcChannelMessageStore">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
    <property name="channelMessageStoreQueryProvider" ref="queryProvider"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="queueChannel">
    <int:queue message-store="store"/>
</int:channel>

<bean id="priorityStore" parent="channelStore">
    <property name="priorityEnabled" value="true"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="priorityChannel">
    <int:priority-queue message-store="priorityStore"/>
</int:channel>
----

==== Initializing the Database

Spring Integration ships with some sample scripts that can be used to initialize a database.
In the spring-integration-jdbc JAR file you will find scripts in the `org.springframework.integration.jdbc` and in the `org.springframework.integration.jdbc.store.channel` package: there is a create and a drop script example for a range of common database platforms.
A common way to use these scripts is to reference them in a http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html#jdbc-intializing-datasource[Spring JDBC data source initializer].
Note that the scripts are provided as samples or specifications of the the required table and column names.
You may find that you need to enhance them for production use (e.g.
with index declarations).

==== Partitioning a Message Store

It is common to use a `JdbcMessageStore` as a global store for a group of applications, or nodes in the same application.
To provide some protection against name clashes, and to give control over the database meta-data configuration, the message store allows the tables to be partitioned in two ways.
One is to use separate table names, by changing the prefix as described above, and the other is to specify a "region" name for partitioning data within a single table.
An important use case for this is when the MessageStore is managing persistent queues backing a Spring Integration Message Channel.
The message data for a persistent channel is keyed in the store on the channel name, so if the channel names are not globally unique then there is the danger of channels picking up data that was not intended for them.
To avoid this, the message store _region_ can be used to keep data separate for different physical channels that happen to have the same logical name.

[[stored-procedures]]
=== Stored Procedures

In certain situations plain JDBC support is not sufficient.
Maybe you deal with legacy relational database schemas or you have complex data processing needs, but ultimately you have to use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure[Stored Procedures] or Stored Functions.
Since Spring Integration 2.1, we provide three components in order to execute Stored Procedures or Stored Functions:

* Stored Procedures Inbound Channel Adapter
* Stored Procedures Outbound Channel Adapter
* Stored Procedures Outbound Gateway



[[sp-supported-databases]]
==== Supported Databases

In order to enable calls to _Stored Procedures_ and _Stored Functions_, the Stored Procedure components use the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/simple/SimpleJdbcCall.html[`org.springframework.jdbc.core.simple.SimpleJdbcCall`] class.
Consequently, the following databases are fully supported for executing Stored Procedures:

* Apache Derby
* DB2
* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* Sybase


If you want to execute Stored Functions instead, the following databases are fully supported:

* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL



[NOTE]
=====
Even though your particular database may not be fully supported, chances are, that you can use the Stored Procedure Spring Integration components quite successfully anyway, provided your RDBMS supports Stored Procedures or Functions.

As a matter of fact, some of the provided integration tests use the http://www.h2database.com/[H2 database].
Nevertheless, it is very important to thoroughly test those usage scenarios.
=====

[[sp-configuration]]
==== Configuration

The Stored Procedure components provide full XML Namespace support and configuring the components is similar as for the general purpose JDBC components discussed earlier.

[[sp-common-config-params]]
==== Common Configuration Attributes

Certain configuration parameters are shared among all Stored Procedure components and are described below:

*auto-startup*

Lifecycle attribute signaling if this component should be started during Application Context startup.
Defaults to `true`.
_Optional_.

*data-source*

Reference to a `javax.sql.DataSource`, which is used to access the database._Required_.

*id*

Identifies the underlying Spring bean definition, which is an instance of either `EventDrivenConsumer` or `PollingConsumer`, depending on whether the Outbound Channel Adapter's `channel` attribute references a `SubscribableChannel` or a `PollableChannel`.
_Optional_.

*ignore-column-meta-data*

For fully supported databases, the underlying http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/simple/SimpleJdbcCall.html[`SimpleJdbcCall`] class can automatically retrieve the parameter information for the to be invoked Stored Procedure or Function from the JDBC Meta-data.

However, if the used database does not support meta data lookups or if you like to provide customized parameter definitions, this flag can be set to `true`.
It defaults to `false`.
_Optional_.

*is-function*

If `true`, a SQL Function is called.
In that case the `stored-procedure-name` or `stored-procedure-name-expression` attributes define the name of the called function.
Defaults to `false`.
_Optional_.

*stored-procedure-name*

The attribute specifies the name of the stored procedure.
If the `is-function` attribute is set to `true`, this attribute specifies the function name instead.
Either this property or _stored-procedure-name-expression_ must be specified.

*stored-procedure-name-expression*

This attribute specifies the name of the stored procedure using a SpEL expression.
Using SpEL you have access to the full message (if available), including its headers and payload.
You can use this attribute to invoke different Stored Procedures at runtime.
For example, you can provide Stored Procedure names that you would like to execute as a Message Header.
The expression must resolve to a String.

If the `is-function` attribute is set to `true`, this attribute specifies a Stored Function.
Either this property or _stored-procedure-name_ must be specified.

*jdbc-call-operations-cache-size*

Defines the maximum number of cached `SimpleJdbcCallOperations` instances.
Basically, for each Stored Procedure Name a newhttp://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/simple/SimpleJdbcCallOperations.html[`SimpleJdbcCallOperations`] instance is created that in return is being cached.

NOTE: The _stored-procedure-name-expression_ attribute and the _jdbc-call-operations-cache-size_ were added with Spring Integration 2.2.

The default cache size is _10_.
A value of _0_ disables caching.
Negative values are not permitted.

If you enable JMX, statistical information about the _
				jdbc-call-operations-cache_ is exposed as MBean.
Please see <<jmx-mbean-exporter>> for more information.

*sql-parameter-source-factory* (Not available for the Stored Procedure Inbound Channel Adapter.)

Reference to a `SqlParameterSourceFactory`.
By default bean properties of the passed in `Message` payload will be used as a source for the Stored Procedure's input parameters using a `BeanPropertySqlParameterSourceFactory`.

This may be sufficient for basic use cases.
For more sophisticated options, consider passing in one or more `ProcedureParameter`.
Please also refer to <<sp-defining-parameter-sources>>.
_Optional_.

*use-payload-as-parameter-source* (Not available for the Stored Procedure Inbound Channel Adapter.)

If set to `true`, the payload of the Message will be used as a source for providing parameters.
If false, however, the entire Message will be available as a source for parameters.

If no Procedure Parameters are passed in, this property will default to `true`.
This means that using a default `BeanPropertySqlParameterSourceFactory` the bean properties of the payload will be used as a source for parameter values for the to-be-executed Stored Procedure or Stored Function.

However, if Procedure Parameters are passed in, then this property will by default evaluate to `false`.
`ProcedureParameter` allow for SpEL Expressions to be provided and therefore it is highly beneficial to have access to the entire Message.
The property is set on the underlying `StoredProcExecutor`.
_Optional_.

[[sp-common-config-subelements]]
==== Common Configuration Sub-Elements

The Stored Procedure components share a common set of sub-elements to define and pass parameters to Stored Procedures or Functions.
The following elements are available:

* parameter
* returning-resultset
* sql-parameter-definition
* poller



*parameter*

Provides a mechanism to provide Stored Procedure parameters.
Parameters can be either static or provided using a SpEL Expressions._Optional_.

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:parameter name=""     <1>
                    type=""     <2>
                    value=""/>  <3>

<int-jdbc:parameter name=""
                    expression=""/> <4>
----

<1> The name of the parameter to be passed into the Stored Procedure or Stored Function._Required_.


<2> This attribute specifies the type of the value.
If nothing is provided this attribute will default to `java.lang.String`.
This attribute is only used when the `value` attribute is used._Optional_.


<3> The value of the parameter.
You have to provider either this attribute or the `expression` attribute must be provided instead._Optional_.


<4> Instead of the `value` attribute, you can also specify a SpEL expression for passing the value of the parameter.
If you specify the `expression` the `value` attribute is not allowed.
_Optional_.

*returning-resultset*

Stored Procedures may return multiple resultsets.
By setting one or more `returning-resultset` elements, you can specify `RowMappers` in order to convert each returned `ResultSet` to meaningful objects.
_Optional_.

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:returning-resultset name="" row-mapper="" />
----

*sql-parameter-definition*

If you are using a database that is fully supported, you typically don't have to specify the Stored Procedure parameter definitions.
Instead, those parameters can be automatically derived from the JDBC Meta-data.
However, if you are using databases that are not fully supported, you must set those parameters explicitly using the `sql-parameter-definition` sub-element.

You can also choose to turn off any processing of parameter meta data information obtained via JDBC using the `ignore-column-meta-data` attribute.

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:sql-parameter-definition
                                   name=""                           <1>
                                   direction="IN"                    <2>
                                   type="STRING"                     <3>
                                   scale="5"                         <4>
                                   type-name="FOO_STRUCT"            <5>
                                   return-type="fooSqlReturnType"/>  <6>
----

<1> Specifies the name of the SQL parameter.
_Required_.


<2> Specifies the direction of the SQL parameter definition.
Defaults to `IN`.
Valid values are: `IN`, `OUT` and `INOUT`.
If your procedure is returning ResultSets, please use the `returning-resultset` element.
_Optional_.


<3> The SQL type used for this SQL parameter definition.
Will translate into the integer value as defined by java.sql.Types.
Alternatively you can provide the integer value as well.
If this attribute is not explicitly set, then it will default to 'VARCHAR'._Optional_.


<4> The scale of the SQL parameter.
Only used for numeric and decimal parameters._Optional_.


<5> The typeName for types that are user-named like: STRUCT, DISTINCT, JAVA_OBJECT, named array types.
This attribute is mutually exclusive with the _scale_ attribute.
_Optional_.


<6> The reference to a custom value handler for complex types.
An implementation of http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlReturnType.html[SqlReturnType].
This attribute is mutually exclusive with the _scale_ attribute and is applicable for OUT(INOUT)-parameters only._Optional_.

*poller*

Allows you to configure a Message Poller if this endpoint is a `PollingConsumer`.
_Optional_.

[[sp-defining-parameter-sources]]
==== Defining Parameter Sources

Parameter Sources govern the techniques of retrieving and mapping the Spring Integration Message properties to the relevant Stored Procedure input parameters.
The Stored Procedure components follow certain rules.

By default bean properties of the passed in `Message` payload will be used as a source for the Stored Procedure's input parameters.
In that case a `BeanPropertySqlParameterSourceFactory` will be used.
This may be sufficient for basic use cases.
The following example illustrates that default behavior.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that for the "automatic" lookup of bean properties using the `BeanPropertySqlParameterSourceFactory` to work, your bean properties must be defined in lower case.
This is due to the fact that in `org.springframework.jdbc.core.metadata.CallMetaDataContext` (method matchInParameterValuesWithCallParameters()), the retrieved Stored Procedure parameter declarations are converted to lower case.
As a result, if you have camel-case bean properties such as "lastName", the lookup will fail.
In that case, please provide an explicit `ProcedureParameter`.

Let's assume we have a payload that consists of a simple bean with the following three properties: _id_, _name_ and _description_.
Furthermore, we have a simplistic Stored Procedure called _INSERT_COFFEE_ that accepts three input parameters: _id_, _name_ and _description_.
We also use a fully supported database.
In that case the following configuration for a Stored Procedure Oubound Adapter will be sufficient:

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:stored-proc-outbound-channel-adapter data-source="dataSource"
    channel="insertCoffeeProcedureRequestChannel"
    stored-procedure-name="INSERT_COFFEE"/>
----

For more sophisticated options consider passing in one or more `ProcedureParameter`.

If you do provide `ProcedureParameter` explicitly, then as default an `ExpressionEvaluatingSqlParameterSourceFactory` will be used for parameter processing in order to enable the full power of SpEL expressions.

Furthermore, if you need even more control over how parameters are retrieved, consider passing in a custom implementation of a `SqlParameterSourceFactory` using the `sql-parameter-source-factory` attribute.

<1> Channel to which polled messages will be sent.
If the stored procedure or function does not return any data, the payload of the Message will be Null.
_Required_.


<2> Limits the number of rows extracted per query.
Otherwise all rows are extracted into the outgoing message._Optional_.


<3> If this attribute is set to `true`, then all results from a stored procedure call that don't have a corresponding `SqlOutParameter` declaration will be bypassed.
E.g. Stored Procedures may return an update count value, even though your Stored Procedure only declared a single result parameter.
The exact behavior depends on the used database.
The value is set on the underlying `JdbcTemplate`.
Few developers will probably ever want to process update counts, thus the value defaults to `true`.
_Optional_.


<4> Indicates whether this procedure's return value should be included.
Since _Spring Integration 3.0.__Optional_.

NOTE: When you declare a Poller, you may notice the Poller's _max-messages-per-poll_ attribute.
For information about how it relates to the _max-rows-per-poll_ attribute of the _Stored Procedure Inbound Channel Adapter_, please see <<jdbc-max-rows-per-poll-versus-max-messages-per-poll>> for a thourough discussion.
The meaning of the attributes is the same as for the _JDBC Inbound Channel Adapter_.

[[sp-examples]]
==== Examples

In the following two examples we call http://db.apache.org/derby/[Apache Derby] Stored Procedures.
The first procedure will call a Stored Procedure that returns a `ResultSet`, and using a `RowMapper` the data is converted into a domain object, which then becomes the Spring Integration message payload.

In the second sample we call a Stored Procedure that uses Output Parameters instead, in order to return data.

[NOTE]
=====
Please have a look at the _Spring Integration Samples_ project, located at null

The project contains the Apache Derby example referenced here, as well as instruction on how to run it.
The_Spring Integration Samples_ project also provides anhttps://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration-samples/tree/master/intermediate/stored-procedures-oracle[example] using Oracle Stored Procedures.
=====

In the first example, we call a Stored Procedure named _FIND_ALL_COFFEE_BEVERAGES_ that does not define any input parameters but which returns a `ResultSet`.

In Apache Derby, Stored Procedures are implemented using Java.
Here is the method signature followed by the corresponding Sql:

[source,java]
----
public static void findAllCoffeeBeverages(ResultSet[] coffeeBeverages)
            throws SQLException {
    ...
}
----

[source,xml]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE FIND_ALL_COFFEE_BEVERAGES() \
PARAMETER STYLE JAVA LANGUAGE JAVA MODIFIES SQL DATA DYNAMIC RESULT SETS 1 \
EXTERNAL NAME 'org.springframework.integration.jdbc.storedproc.derby.DerbyStoredProcedures.findAllCoffeeBeverages';

----

In Spring Integration, you can now call this Stored Procedure using e.g.
a `stored-proc-outbound-gateway`

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:stored-proc-outbound-gateway id="outbound-gateway-storedproc-find-all"
                                       data-source="dataSource"
                                       request-channel="findAllProcedureRequestChannel"
                                       expect-single-result="true"
                                       stored-procedure-name="FIND_ALL_COFFEE_BEVERAGES">
<int-jdbc:returning-resultset name="coffeeBeverages"
    row-mapper="org.springframework.integration.support.CoffeBeverageMapper"/>
</int-jdbc:stored-proc-outbound-gateway>
----

In the second example, we call a Stored Procedure named _FIND_COFFEE_ that has one input parameter.
Instead of returning a ResultSet, an output parameter is used:

[source,java]
----
public static void findCoffee(int coffeeId, String[] coffeeDescription)
            throws SQLException {
    ...
}
----

[source,sql]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE FIND_COFFEE(IN ID INTEGER, OUT COFFEE_DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(200)) \
PARAMETER STYLE JAVA LANGUAGE JAVA EXTERNAL NAME \
'org.springframework.integration.jdbc.storedproc.derby.DerbyStoredProcedures.findCoffee';
----

In Spring Integration, you can now call this Stored Procedure using e.g.
a `stored-proc-outbound-gateway`

[source,xml]
----
<int-jdbc:stored-proc-outbound-gateway id="outbound-gateway-storedproc-find-coffee"
                                       data-source="dataSource"
                                       request-channel="findCoffeeProcedureRequestChannel"
                                       skip-undeclared-results="true"
                                       stored-procedure-name="FIND_COFFEE"
                                       expect-single-result="true">
    <int-jdbc:parameter name="ID" expression="payload" />
</int-jdbc:stored-proc-outbound-gateway>

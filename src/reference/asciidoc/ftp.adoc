== FTP/FTPS Adapters

Spring Integration provides support for file transfer operations via FTP and FTPS.

[[ftp-intro]]
=== Introduction

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a simple network protocol which allows you to transfer files between two computers on the Internet.

There are two actors when it comes to FTP communication: _client_ and _server_.
To transfer files with FTP/FTPS, you use a _client_ which initiates a connection to a remote computer that is running an FTP _server_.
After the connection is established, the _client_ can choose to send and/or receive copies of files.

Spring Integration supports sending and receiving files over FTP/FTPS by providing three _client_ side endpoints: _Inbound Channel Adapter_, _Outbound Channel Adapter_, and _Outbound Gateway_.
It also provides convenient namespace-based configuration options for defining these _client_ components.

To use the _FTP_ namespace, add the following to the header of your XML file:
[source,xml]

[[ftp-session-factory]]
=== FTP Session Factory

IMPORTANT: Starting with version 3.0, sessions are no longer cached by default.
See <<ftp-session-caching>>.

Before configuring FTP adapters you must configure an _FTP Session Factory_.
You can configure the _FTP Session Factory_ with a regular bean definition where the implementation class is `org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpSessionFactory`: Below is a basic configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="ftpClientFactory"
    class="org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpSessionFactory">
    <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
    <property name="port" value="22"/>
    <property name="username" value="kermit"/>
    <property name="password" value="frog"/>
    <property name="clientMode" value="0"/>
    <property name="fileType" value="2"/>
    <property name="bufferSize" value="100000"/>
</bean>
----

For FTPS connections all you need to do is use `org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpsSessionFactory` instead.
Below is the complete configuration sample:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="ftpClientFactory"
    class="org.springframework.integration.ftp.client.DefaultFtpsClientFactory">
    <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
    <property name="port" value="22"/>
    <property name="username" value="oleg"/>
    <property name="password" value="password"/>
    <property name="clientMode" value="1"/>
    <property name="fileType" value="2"/>
    <property name="useClientMode" value="true"/>
    <property name="cipherSuites" value="a,b.c"/>
    <property name="keyManager" ref="keyManager"/>
    <property name="protocol" value="SSL"/>
    <property name="trustManager" ref="trustManager"/>
    <property name="prot" value="P"/>
    <property name="needClientAuth" value="true"/>
    <property name="authValue" value="oleg"/>
    <property name="sessionCreation" value="true"/>
    <property name="protocols" value="SSL, TLS"/>
    <property name="implicit" value="true"/>
</bean>
----

Every time an adapter requests a session object from its `SessionFactory` the session is returned from a session pool maintained by a caching wrapper around the factory.
A Session in the session pool might go stale (if it has been disconnected by the server due to inactivity) so the `SessionFactory` will perform validation to make sure that it never returns a stale session to the adapter.
If a stale session was encountered, it will be removed from the pool, and a new one will be created.

NOTE: If you experience connectivity problems and would like to trace Session creation as well as see which Sessions are polled you may enable it by setting the logger to TRACE level (e.g., log4j.category.org.springframework.integration.file=TRACE)

Now all you need to do is inject these session factories into your adapters.
Obviously the protocol (FTP or FTPS) that an adapter will use depends on the type of session factory that has been injected into the adapter.

NOTE: A more practical way to provide values for _FTP/FTPS Session Factories_ is by using Spring's property placeholder support (See: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer).

*Advanced Configuration*

`DefaultFtpSessionFactory` provides an abstraction over the underlying client API which, since _Spring Integration 2.0_, is http://commons.apache.org/net/[Apache Commons Net].
This spares you from the low level configuration details of the `org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient`.
Several common properties are exposed on the session factory (since _version 4.0_, this now includes `connectTimeout`, `defaultTimeout` and `dataTimeout`).
However there are times when access to lower level `FTPClient` configuration is necessary to achieve more advanced configuration (e.g., setting the port range for active mode etc.).
For that purpose, `AbstractFtpSessionFactory` (the base class for all FTP Session Factories) exposes hooks, in the form of the two post-processing methods below.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Will handle additional initialization after client.connect() method was invoked,
 * but before any action on the client has been taken
 */
protected void postProcessClientAfterConnect(T t) throws IOException {
    // NOOP
}
/**
 * Will handle additional initialization before client.connect() method was invoked.
 */
protected void postProcessClientBeforeConnect(T client) throws IOException {
    // NOOP
}
----

As you can see, there is no default implementation for these two methods.
However, by extending `DefaultFtpSessionFactory` you can override these methods to provide more advanced configuration of the `FTPClient`.
For example:
[source,java]
----
public class AdvancedFtpSessionFactory extends DefaultFtpSessionFactory {

    protected void postProcessClientBeforeConnect(FTPClient ftpClient) throws IOException {
       ftpClient.setActivePortRange(4000, 5000);
    }
}
----

[[ftp-dsf]]
=== Delegating Session Factory

_Version 4.2_ introduced the `DelegatingSessionFactory` which allows the selection of the actual session factory at
runtime.
Prior to invoking the ftp endpoint, call `setThreadKey()` on the factory to associate a key with the current thread.
That key is then used to lookup the actual session factory to be used.
The key can be cleared by calling `clearThreadKey()` after use.

Convenience methods have been added so this can easily be done from a message flow:

[source, xml]
----
<bean id="dsf" class="org.springframework.integration.file.remote.session.DelegatingSessionFactory">
    <constructor-arg>
        <bean class="o.s.i.file.remote.session.DefaultSessionFactoryLocator">
            <!-- delegate factories here -->
        </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>

<int:service-activator input-channel="in" output-channel="c1"
        expression="@dsf.setThreadKey(#root, headers['factoryToUse'])" />

<int-ftp:outbound-gateway request-channel="c1" reply-channel="c2" ... />

<int:service-activator input-channel="c2" output-channel="out"
        expression="@dsf.clearThreadKey(#root)" />
----

IMPORTANT: When using session caching (see <<ftp-session-caching>>), each of the delegates should be cached; you
cannot cache the `DelegatingSessionFactory` itself.

[[ftp-inbound]]
=== FTP Inbound Channel Adapter

The _FTP Inbound Channel Adapter_ is a special listener that will connect to the FTP server and will listen for the remote directory events (e.g., new file created) at which point it will initiate a file transfer.
[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter id="ftpInbound"
    channel="ftpChannel"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    charset="UTF-8"
    auto-create-local-directory="true"
    delete-remote-files="true"
    filename-pattern="*.txt"
    remote-directory="some/remote/path"
    remote-file-separator="/"
    preserve-timestamp="true"
    local-filename-generator-expression="#this.toUpperCase() + '.a'"
    local-filter="myFilter"
    temporary-file-suffix=".writing"
    local-directory=".">
    <int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

As you can see from the configuration above you can configure an _FTP Inbound Channel Adapter_ via the `inbound-channel-adapter` element while also providing values for various attributes such as `local-directory`, `filename-pattern` (which is based on simple pattern matching, not regular expressions), and of course the reference to a `session-factory`.

By default the transferred file will carry the same name as the original file.
If you want to override this behavior you can set the `local-filename-generator-expression` attribute which allows you to provide a SpEL Expression to generate the name of the local file.
Unlike outbound gateways and adapters where the root object of the SpEL Evaluation Context is a `Message`, this inbound adapter does not yet have the Message at the time of evaluation since that's what it ultimately generates with the transferred file as its payload.
So, the root object of the SpEL Evaluation Context is the original name of the remote file (String).

Starting with _Spring Integration 3.0_, you can specify the `preserve-timestamp` attribute (default `false`); when `true`, the local file's modified timestamp will be set to the value retrieved from the server; otherwise it will be set to the current time.

Starting with _version 4.2_, you can specify `remote-directory-expression` instead of `remote-directory`, allowing
you to dynamically determine the directory on each poll.
e.g `remote-directory-expression="@myBean.determineRemoteDir()"`.

Sometimes file filtering based on the simple pattern specified via `filename-pattern` attribute might not be sufficient.
If this is the case, you can use the `filename-regex` attribute to specify a Regular Expression (e.g.
`filename-regex=".*\.test$"`).
And of course if you need complete control you can use `filter` attribute and provide a reference to any custom implementation of the `org.springframework.integration.file.filters.FileListFilter`, a strategy interface for filtering a list of files.
This filter determines which remote files are retrieved.
You can also combine a pattern based filter with other filters, such as an `AcceptOnceFileListFilter` to avoid synchronizing files that have previously been fetched, by using a `CompositeFileListFilter`.

The `AcceptOnceFileListFilter` stores its state in memory.
If you wish the state to survive a system restart, consider using the`FtpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` instead.
This filter stores the accepted file names in an instance of the`MetadataStore` strategy (<<metadata-store>>).
This filter matches on the filename and the remote modified time.

Since _version 4.0_, this filter requires a `ConcurrentMetadataStore`.
When used with a shared data store (such as `Redis` with the `RedisMetadataStore`) this allows filter keys to be shared across multiple application or server instances.

The above discussion refers to filtering the files before retrieving them.
Once the files have been retrieved, an additional filter is applied to the files on the file system.
By default, this is an`AcceptOnceFileListFilter` which, as discussed, retains state in memory and does not consider the file's modified time.
Unless your application removes files after processing, the adapter will re-process the files on disk by default after an application restart.

Also, if you configure the `filter` to use a `FtpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter`, and the remote file timestamp changes (causing it to be re-fetched), the default local filter will not allow this new file to be processed.

Use the `local-filter` attribute to configure the behavior of the local file system filter.
To solve these particular use cases, you can use a `FileSystemPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` as a local filter instead.
This filter also stores the accepted file names and modified timestamp in an instance of the`MetadataStore` strategy (<<metadata-store>>), and will detect the change in the local file modified time.

Since __version 4.1.5__, these filters have a new property `flushOnUpdate` which will cause them to flush the
metadata store on every update (if the store implements `Flushable`).

IMPORTANT: Further, if you use a distributed `MetadataStore` (such as <<redis-metadata-store>> or <<gemfire-metadata-store>>) you can have multiple instances of the same adapter/application and be sure that one and only one will process a file.

The actual local filter is a `CompositeFileListFilter` containing the supplied filter and a pattern filter that prevents processing files that are in the process of being downloaded (based on the `temporary-file-suffix`); files are downloaded with this suffix (default: `.writing`) and the file is renamed to its final name when the transfer is complete, making it 'visible' to the filter.

The `remote-file-separator` attribute allows you to configure a file separator character to use if the default '/' is not applicable for your particular environment.

Please refer to the schema for more details on these attributes.

It is also important to understand that the _FTP Inbound Channel Adapter_ is a _Polling Consumer_ and therefore you must configure a poller (either via a global default or a local sub-element).
Once a file has been transferred, a Message with a `java.io.File` as its payload will be generated and sent to the channel identified by the `channel` attribute.

_More on File Filtering and Large Files_

Sometimes the file that just appeared in the monitored (remote) directory is not complete.
Typically such a file will be written with temporary extension (e.g., foo.txt.writing) and then renamed after the writing process finished.
As a user in most cases you are only interested in files that are complete and would like to filter only files that are complete.
To handle these scenarios you can use the filtering support provided by the `filename-pattern`, `filename-regex` and `filter` attributes.
Here is an example that uses a custom Filter implementation.

[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter
    channel="ftpChannel"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    filter="customFilter"
    local-directory="file:/my_transfers">
    remote-directory="some/remote/path"

</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>

<bean id="customFilter" class="org.example.CustomFilter"/>

_Poller configuration notes for the inbound FTP adapter_

The job of the inbound FTP adapter consists of two tasks: _1) Communicate with a remote server in order to transfer files from a remote directory to a local directory.__2) For each transferred file, generate a Message with that file as a payload and send it to the channel identified by the 'channel' attribute._ That is why they are called 'channel-adapters' rather than just 'adapters'.
The main job of such an adapter is to generate a Message to be sent to a Message Channel.
Essentially, the second task mentioned above takes precedence in such a way that *IF* your local directory already has one or more files it will first generate Messages from those, and *ONLY* when all local files have been processed, will it initiate the remote communication to retrieve more files.

Also, when configuring a trigger on the poller you should pay close attention to the `max-messages-per-poll` attribute.
Its default value is 1 for all `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` instances (including FTP).
This means that as soon as one file is processed, it will wait for the next execution time as determined by your trigger configuration.
If you happened to have one or more files sitting in the `local-directory`, it would process those files before it would initiate communication with the remote FTP server.
And, if the `max-messages-per-poll` were set to 1 (default), then it would be processing only one file at a time with intervals as defined by your trigger, essentially working as _one-poll = one-file_.

For typical file-transfer use cases, you most likely want the opposite behavior: to process all the files you can for each poll and only then wait for the next poll.
If that is the case, set `max-messages-per-poll` to -1.
Then, on each poll, the adapter will attempt to generate as many Messages as it possibly can.
In other words, it will process everything in the local directory, and then it will connect to the remote directory to transfer everything that is available there to be processed locally.
Only then is the poll operation considered complete, and the poller will wait for the next execution time.

You can alternatively set the 'max-messages-per-poll' value to a positive value indicating the upward limit of Messages to be created from files with each poll.
For example, a value of 10 means that on each poll it will attempt to process no more than 10 files.

==== Recovering from Failures

It is important to understand the architecture of the adapter.
There is a file synchronizer which fetches the files, and a `FileReadingMessageSource` to emit a message for each
synchronized file.
As discussed above, there are two filters involved.
The `filter` attribute (and patterns) refers to the remote (FTP) file list - to avoid fetching files that have already
been fetched.
The `local-filter` is used by the `FileReadingMessageSource` to determine which files are to be sent as messages.

The synchronizer lists the remote files and consults its filter; the files are then transferred.
If an IO error occurs during file transfer, any files that have already been added to the filter are removed so they
are eligible to be re-fetched on the next poll.
This only applies if the filter implements `ReversibleFileListFilter` (such as the `AcceptOnceFileListFilter`).

If, after synchronizing the files, an error occurs on the downstream flow processing a file, there is __no__ automatic
rollback of the filter so the failed file will __not__ be reprocessed by default.

If you wish to reprocess such files after a failure, you can use configuration similar to the following to facilitate
the removal of the failed file from the filter.
This will work for any `ResettableFileListFilter`.

[[ftp-outbound]]
=== FTP Outbound Channel Adapter

The _FTP Outbound Channel Adapter_ relies upon a `MessageHandler` implementation that will connect to the FTP server and initiate an FTP transfer for every file it receives in the payload of incoming Messages.
It also supports several representations of the _File_ so you are not limited only to java.io.File typed payloads.
The _FTP Outbound Channel Adapter_ supports the following payloads: 1) `java.io.File` - the actual file object; 2) `byte[]` - a byte array that represents the file contents; and 3) `java.lang.String` - text that represents the file contents.
[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:outbound-channel-adapter id="ftpOutbound"
    channel="ftpChannel"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    charset="UTF-8"
    remote-file-separator="/"
    auto-create-directory="true"
    remote-directory-expression="headers.['remote_dir']"
    temporary-remote-directory-expression="headers.['temp_remote_dir']"
    filename-generator="fileNameGenerator"
    use-temporary-filename="true"
    mode="REPLACE"/>
----

As you can see from the configuration above you can configure an _FTP Outbound Channel Adapter_ via the `outbound-channel-adapter` element while also providing values for various attributes such as `filename-generator` (an implementation of the `org.springframework.integration.file.FileNameGenerator` strategy interface), a reference to a `session-factory`, as well as other attributes.
You can also see some examples of `*expression` attributes which allow you to use SpEL to configure things like `remote-directory-expression`, `temporary-remote-directory-expression` and `remote-filename-generator-expression` (a SpEL alternative to `filename-generator` shown above).
As with any component that allows the usage of SpEL, access to Payload and Message Headers is available via 'payload' and 'headers' variables.
Please refer to the schema for more details on the available attributes.

NOTE: By default Spring Integration will use `o.s.i.file.DefaultFileNameGenerator` if none is specified.
`DefaultFileNameGenerator` will determine the file name based on the value of the `file_name` header (if it exists) in the MessageHeaders, or if the payload of the Message is already a `java.io.File`, then it will use the original name of that file.

IMPORTANT: Defining certain values (e.g., remote-directory) might be platform/ftp server dependent.
For example as it was reported on this forum http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=333478&posted=1#post333478 on some platforms you must add slash to the end of the directory definition (e.g., remote-directory="/foo/bar/" instead of remote-directory="/foo/bar")

Starting with _version 4.1_, you can specify the `mode` when transferring the file.
By default, an existing file will be overwritten; the modes are defined on `enum` `FileExistsMode`, having values `REPLACE` (default), `APPEND`, `IGNORE`, and `FAIL`.
With `IGNORE` and `FAIL`, the file is not transferred; `FAIL` causes an exception to be thrown whereas `IGNORE` silently ignores the transfer (although a `DEBUG` log entry is produced).

_Avoiding Partially Written Files_

One of the common problems, when dealing with file transfers, is the possibility of processing a _partial file_ - a file might appear in the file system before its transfer is actually complete.

To deal with this issue, Spring Integration FTP adapters use a very common algorithm where files are transferred under a temporary name and then renamed once they are fully transferred.

By default, every file that is in the process of being transferred will appear in the file system with an additional suffix which, by default, is `.writing`; this can be changed using the `temporary-file-suffix` attribute.

However, there may be situations where you don't want to use this technique (for example, if the server does not permit renaming files).
For situations like this, you can disable this feature by setting `use-temporary-file-name` to `false` (default is `true`).
When this attribute is `false`, the file is written with its final name and the consuming application will need some other mechanism to detect that the file is completely uploaded before accessing it.

[[ftp-outbound-gateway]]
=== FTP Outbound Gateway

The _FTP Outbound Gateway_ provides a limited set of commands to interact with a remote FTP/FTPS server.
Commands supported are:

* ls (list files)
* get (retrieve file)
* mget (retrieve file(s))
* rm (remove file(s))
* mv (move/rename file)
* put (send file)
* mput (send multiple files)

*ls*

ls lists remote file(s) and supports the following options:

* -1 - just retrieve a list of filenames, default is to retrieve a list of `FileInfo` objects.
* -a - include all files (including those starting with '.')
* -f - do not sort the list
* -dirs - include directories (excluded by default)
* -links - include symbolic links (excluded by default)
* -R - list the remote directory recursively

In addition, filename filtering is provided, in the same manner as the `inbound-channel-adapter`.

The message payload resulting from an _ls_ operation is a list of file names, or a list of `FileInfo` objects.
These objects provide information such as modified time, permissions etc.

The remote directory that the _ls_ command acted on is provided in the `file_remoteDirectory` header.

When using the recursive option (`-R`), the `fileName` includes any subdirectory elements, representing a relative path to the file (relative to the remote directory).
If the `-dirs` option is included, each recursive directory is also returned as an element in the list.
In this case, it is recommended that the `-1` is not used because you would not be able to determine files Vs.
directories, which is achievable using the `FileInfo` objects.

*get*

_get_ retrieves a remote file and supports the following option:

* -P - preserve the timestamp of the remote file

* -stream - retrieve the remote file as a stream.

The remote directory is provided in the `file_remoteDirectory` header, and the filename is provided in the `file_remoteFile` header.

The message payload resulting from a _get_ operation is a `File` object representing the retrieved file, or
an `InputStream` when the `-stream` option is provided.
This option allows retrieving the file as a stream.
For text files, a common use case is to combine this operation with a <<file-splitter>>.
When consuming remote files as streams, the user is responsible for closing the `Session` after the stream is
consumed.
For convenience, the `Session` is provided in the `file_remoteSession` header.

The following shows an example of consuming a file as a stream:

[source, xml]
----
<int-ftp:outbound-gateway session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
                            request-channel="inboundGetStream"
                            command="get"
                            command-options="-stream"
                            expression="payload"
                            remote-directory="ftpTarget"
                            reply-channel="stream" />

<int:chain input-channel="stream">
    <int-file:splitter markers="true" />
    <int:payload-type-router resolution-required="false" default-output-channel="output">
        <int:mapping type="org.springframework.integration.file.splitter.FileSplitter$FileMarker"
                    channel="markers" />
    </int:payload-type-router>
</int:chain>

<int:service-activator input-channel="markers"
    expression="payload.mark.toString().equals('END') ? headers['file_remoteSession'].close() : null"/>
----

The file lines are sent to the channel `output`.

*mget*

_mget_ retrieves multiple remote files based on a pattern and supports the following option:

* -P - preserve the timestamps of the remote files


* -x - Throw an exception if no files match the pattern (otherwise an empty list is returned)

The message payload resulting from an _mget_ operation is a `List<File>` object - a List of File objects, each representing a retrieved file.

The remote directory is provided in the `file_remoteDirectory` header, and the pattern for the filenames is provided in the `file_remoteFile` header.

[NOTE]
.Notes for when using recursion (`-R`)
=====
The pattern is ignored, and `*` is assumed.
By default, the entire remote tree is retrieved.
However, files in the tree can be filtered, by providing a`FileListFilter`; directories in the tree can also be filtered this way.
A `FileListFilter` can be provided by reference or by `filename-pattern` or `filename-regex` attributes.
For example, `filename-regex="(subDir|.*1.txt)"` will retrieve all files ending with `1.txt` in the remote directory and the subdirectory `subDir`.
If a subdirectory is filtered, no additional traversal of that subdirectory is performed.

The `-dirs` option is not allowed (the recursive mget uses the recursive `ls` to obtain the directory tree and the directories themselves cannot be included in the list).

Typically, you would use the `#remoteDirectory` variable in the `local-directory-expression` so that the remote directory structure is retained locally.
=====

See also <<ftp-partial>>.

*put*

_put_ sends a file to the remote server; the payload of the message can be a `java.io.File`, a `byte[]` or a `String`.
A `remote-filename-generator` (or expression) is used to name the remote file.
Other available attributes include `remote-directory`, `temporary-remote-directory` (and their `*-expression`) equivalents, `use-temporary-file-name`, and `auto-create-directory`.
Refer to the schema documentation for more information.

The message payload resulting from a _put_ operation is a `String` representing the full path of the file on the server after transfer.

*mput*

_mput_ sends multiple files to the server and supports the following option:

* -R - Recursive - send all files (possibly filtered) in the directory and subdirectories

The message payload must be a `java.io.File` representing a local directory.

The same attributes as the `put` command are supported.
In addition, files in the local directory can be filtered with one of `mput-pattern`, `mput-regex` or `mput-filter`.
The filter works with recursion, as long as the subdirectories themselves pass the filter.
Subdirectories that do not pass the filter are not recursed.

The message payload resulting from an _mget_ operation is a `List<String>` object - a List of remote file paths resulting from the transfer.

See also <<ftp-partial>>.

*rm*

The _rm_ command has no options.

The message payload resulting from an _rm_ operation is Boolean.TRUE if the remove was successful, Boolean.FALSE otherwise.
The remote directory is provided in the `file_remoteDirectory` header, and the filename is provided in the `file_remoteFile` header.

*mv*

The _mv_ command has no options.

The _expression_ attribute defines the "from" path and the _rename-expression_ attribute defines the "to" path.
By default, the _rename-expression_ is `headers['file_renameTo']`.
This expression must not evaluate to null, or an empty `String`.
If necessary, any remote directories needed will be created.
The payload of the result message is `Boolean.TRUE`.
The original remote directory is provided in the `file_remoteDirectory` header, and the filename is provided in the `file_remoteFile` header.
The new path is in the `file_renameTo` header.

*Additional Information*

The _get_ and _mget_ commands support the _local-filename-generator-expression_ attribute.
It defines a SpEL expression to generate the name of local file(s) during the transfer.
The root object of the evaluation context is the request Message but, in addition, the `remoteFileName` variable is also available, which is particularly useful for _mget_, for example: `local-filename-generator-expression="#remoteFileName.toUpperCase() + headers.foo"`.

The _get_ and _mget_ commands support the _local-directory-expression_ attribute.
It defines a SpEL expression to generate the name of local directory(ies) during the transfer.
The root object of the evaluation context is the request Message but, in addition, the `remoteDirectory` variable is also available, which is particularly useful for _mget_, for example: `local-directory-expression="'/tmp/local/' + #remoteDirectory.toUpperCase() + headers.foo"`.
This attribute is mutually exclusive with _local-directory_ attribute.

For all commands, the PATH that the command acts on is provided by the 'expression' property of the gateway.
For the mget command, the expression might evaluate to '*', meaning retrieve all files, or 'somedirectory/*' etc.

Here is an example of a gateway configured for an ls command...

[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:outbound-gateway id="gateway1"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    request-channel="inbound1"
    command="ls"
    command-options="-1"
    expression="payload"
    reply-channel="toSplitter"/>
----

The payload of the message sent to the toSplitter channel is a list of String objects containing the filename of each
file.
If the `command-options` was omitted, it would be a list of `FileInfo` objects.
Options are provided space-delimited, e.g.
`command-options="-1 -dirs -links"`.

Starting with _version 4.2_, the `GET`, `MGET`, `PUT` and `MPUT` commands support a `FileExistsMode` property (`mode`
when using the namespace support). This affects the behavior when the local file exists (`GET` and `MGET`) or the remote
file exists (`PUT` and `MPUT`). Supported modes are `REPLACE`, `APPEND`, `FAIL` and `IGNORE`.
For backwards compatibility, the default mode for `PUT` and `MPUT` operations is `REPLACE` and for `GET` and `MGET`
operations, the default is `FAIL`.

[[ftp-partial]]
==== Outbound Gateway Partial Success (mget and mput)

When performing operations on multiple files (`mget` and `mput`) it is possible that an exception occurs some time after
one or more files have been transferred.
In this case (starting with _version 4.2_), a `PartialSuccessException` is thrown.
As well as the usual `MessagingException` properties (`failedMessage` and `cause`), this exception has two additional
properties:

- `partialResults` - the successful transfer results.
- `derivedInput` - the list of files generated from the request message (e.g. local files to transfer for an `mput`).

This will enable you to determine which files were successfully transferred, and which were not.

In the case of a recursive `mput`, the `PartialSuccessException` may have nested `PartialSuccessException` s.

Consider:

[source]
----
root/
|- file1.txt
|- subdir/
   | - file2.txt
   | - file3.txt
|- zoo.txt
----

If the exception occurs on `file3.txt`, the `PartialSuccessException` thrown by the gateway will have `derivedInput`
of `file1.txt`, `subdir`, `zoo.txt` and `partialResults` of `file1.txt`.
It's `cause` will be another `PartialSuccessException` with `derivedInput` of `file2.txt`, `file3.txt` and
`partialResults` of `file2.txt`.


[[ftp-session-caching]]
=== FTP Session Caching

IMPORTANT: Starting with _Spring Integration version 3.0_, sessions are no longer cached by default; the `cache-sessions` attribute is no longer supported on endpoints.
You must use a `CachingSessionFactory` (see below) if you wish to cache sessions.

In versions prior to 3.0, the sessions were cached automatically by default.
A `cache-sessions` attribute was available for disabling the auto caching, but that solution did not provide a way to configure other session caching attributes.
For example, you could not limit on the number of sessions created.
To support that requirement and other configuration options, a `CachingSessionFactory` was provided.
It provides `sessionCacheSize` and `sessionWaitTimeout` properties.
As its name suggests, the `sessionCacheSize` property controls how many active sessions the factory will maintain in its cache (the DEFAULT is unbounded).
If the `sessionCacheSize` threshold has been reached, any attempt to acquire another session will block until either one of the cached sessions becomes available or until the wait time for a Session expires (the DEFAULT wait time is Integer.MAX_VALUE).
The `sessionWaitTimeout` property enables configuration of that value.

If you want your Sessions to be cached, simply configure your default Session Factory as described above and then wrap it in an instance of `CachingSessionFactory` where you may provide those additional properties.

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="ftpSessionFactory" class="o.s.i.ftp.session.DefaultFtpSessionFactory">
    <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
</bean>

<bean id="cachingSessionFactory" class="o.s.i.file.remote.session.CachingSessionFactory">
    <constructor-arg ref="ftpSessionFactory"/>
    <constructor-arg value="10"/>
    <property name="sessionWaitTimeout" value="1000"/>
</bean>
----

In the above example you see a `CachingSessionFactory` created with the `sessionCacheSize` set to 10 and the
`sessionWaitTimeout` set to 1 second (its value is in milliseconds).

Starting with _Spring Integration version 3.0_, the `CachingConnectionFactory` provides a `resetCache()` method.
When invoked, all idle sessions are immediately closed and in-use sessions are closed when they are returned to the cache.
New requests for sessions will establish new sessions as necessary.

[[ftp-rft]]
=== RemoteFileTemplate

Starting with _Spring Integration version 3.0_ a new abstraction is provided over the `FtpSession` object.
The template provides methods to send, retrieve (as an `InputStream`), remove, and rename files.
In addition an `execute` method is provided allowing the caller to execute multiple operations on the session.
In all cases, the template takes care of reliably closing the session.
For more information, refer to the
http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/file/remote/RemoteFileTemplate.html[JavaDocs for `RemoteFileTemplate`].
There is a subclass for FTP: `FtpRemoteFileTemplate`.

Additional methods were added in _version 4.1_ including `getClientInstance()` which provides access to the underlying `FTPClient` enabling access to low-level APIs.

[[ftp-session-callback]]
=== MessageSessionCallback

Starting with _Spring Integration version 4.2_, a `MessageSessionCallback<F, T>` implementation can be used with the
`<int-ftp:outbound-gateway/>` (`FtpOutboundGateway`) to perform any operation(s) on the `Session<FTPFile>` with
the `requestMessage` context.
It can be used for any non-standard or low-level FTP operation (or several); for example, allowing access
from an integration flow definition, and _functional_ interface (Lambda) implementation injection:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "ftpChannel")
public MessageHandler ftpOutboundGateway(SessionFactory<FTPFile> sessionFactory) {
    return new FtpOutboundGateway(sessionFactory,
         (session, requestMessage) -> session.list(requestMessage.getPayload()));
}
----

Another example might be to pre- or post- process the file data being sent/retrieved.

When using XML configuration, the `<int-ftp:outbound-gateway/>` provides a `session-callback` attribute to allow you to
specify the `MessageSessionCallback` bean name.

NOTE: The `session-callback` is mutually exclusive with the `command` and `expression` attributes.
When configuring with Java, different constructors are available in the `FtpOutboundGateway` class.

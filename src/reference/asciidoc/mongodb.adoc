== MongoDb Support

As of version 2.1 Spring Integration introduces support for http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB]: a _"high-performance, open source, document-oriented database"_.
This support comes in the form of a MongoDB-based MessageStore.

[[mongodb-intro]]
=== Introduction

To download, install, and run MongoDB please refer to the http://www.mongodb.org/downloads[MongoDB documentation].

[[mongodb-connection]]
=== Connecting to MongoDb

To begin interacting with MongoDB you first need to connect to it.
Spring Integration builds on the support provided by another Spring project, http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/mongodb[Spring Data MongoDB], which provides a factory class called `MongoDbFactory` that simplifies integration with the MongoDB Client API.

_MongoDbFactory_

To connect to MongoDB you can use an implementation of the `MongoDbFactory` interface:
[source,java]
----
public interface MongoDbFactory {

	/**
	 * Creates a default {@link DB} instance.
	 *
	 * @return the DB instance
	 * @throws DataAccessException
	 */
	DB getDb() throws DataAccessException;

	/**
	 * Creates a {@link DB} instance to access the database with the given name.
	 *
	 * @param dbName must not be {@literal null} or empty.
	 *
	 * @return the DB instance
	 * @throws DataAccessException
	 */
	DB getDb(String dbName) throws DataAccessException;
}
----

The example below shows `SimpleMongoDbFactory`, the out-of-the-box implementation:

In Java:
[source,java]
----
MongoDbFactory mongoDbFactory = new SimpleMongoDbFactory(new Mongo(), "test");
----

Or in Spring's XML configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="mongoDbFactory" class="o.s.data.mongodb.core.SimpleMongoDbFactory">
    <constructor-arg>
        <bean class="com.mongodb.Mongo"/>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg value="test"/>
</bean>
----

As you can see `SimpleMongoDbFactory` takes two arguments: 1) a `Mongo` instance and 2) a String specifying the name of the database.
If you need to configure properties such as `host`, `port`, etc, you can pass those using one of the constructors provided by the underlying `Mongo` class.
For more information on how to configure MongoDB, please refer to thehttp://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-document/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring-Data-Document] reference.

[[mongodb-message-store]]
=== MongoDB Message Store

As described in EIP, a http://www.eaipatterns.com/MessageStore.html[Message Store] allows you to persist Messages.
This can be very useful when dealing with components that have a capability to buffer messages (_QueueChannel, Aggregator, Resequencer_, etc.) if reliability is a concern.
In Spring Integration, the MessageStore strategy also provides the foundation for thehttp://www.eaipatterns.com/StoreInLibrary.html[ClaimCheck] pattern, which is described in EIP as well.

Spring Integration's MongoDB module provides the `MongoDbMessageStore` which is an implementation of both the `MessageStore` strategy (mainly used by the _ClaimCheck_pattern) and the `MessageGroupStore` strategy (mainly used by the _Aggregator_ and _Resequencer_ patterns).

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="mongoDbMessageStore" class="o.s.i.mongodb.store.MongoDbMessageStore">
    <constructor-arg ref="mongoDbFactory"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="somePersistentQueueChannel">
    <int:queue message-store="mongoDbMessageStore"/>
<int:channel>

<int:aggregator input-channel="inputChannel" output-channel="outputChannel"
         message-store="mongoDbMessageStore"/>
----

Above is a sample `MongoDbMessageStore` configuration that shows its usage by a _QueueChannel_ and an _Aggregator_.
As you can see it is a simple bean configuration, and it expects a `MongoDbFactory` as a constructor argument.

The `MongoDbMessageStore` expands the `Message` as a Mongo document with all nested properties using the Spring Data Mongo Mapping mechanism.
It is useful when you need to have access to the `payload` or `headers` for auditing or analytics, for example, against stored messages.

IMPORTANT: The `MongoDbMessageStore` uses a custom `MappingMongoConverter` implementation to store `Message` s as MongoDB documents and there are some limitations for the properties (`payload` and `header` values) of the `Message`.
For example, there is no ability to configure custom converters for complex domain `payload` s or `header` values.
Or to provide a custom `MongoTemplate` (or `MappingMongoConverter`).
To achieve these capabilities, an alternative MongoDB `MessageStore` implementation has been introduced; see next paragraph.

_Spring Integration 3.0_ introduced the `ConfigurableMongoDbMessageStore` - `MessageStore` and `MessageGroupStore` implementation.
This class can receive, as a constructor argument, a `MongoTemplate`, with which you can configure with a custom `WriteConcern`, for example.
Another constructor requires a `MappingMongoConverter`, and a `MongoDbFactory`, which allows you to provide some custom conversions for `Message` s and their properties.
Note, by default, the `ConfigurableMongoDbMessageStore` uses standard Java serialization to write/read `Message` s to/from MongoDB and relies on default values for other properties from `MongoTemplate`, which is built from the provided `MongoDbFactory` and `MappingMongoConverter`.
The default name for the collection stored by the `ConfigurableMongoDbMessageStore` is `configurableStoreMessages`.
It is recommended to use this implementation for robust and flexible solutions when messages contain complex data types.

[[mongodb-priority-channel-message-store]]
==== MongoDB Channel Message Store

Starting with _version 4.0_, the new `MongoDbChannelMessageStore` has been introduced; it is an optimized `MessageGroupStore` for use in `QueueChannel` s.
With `priorityEnabled = true`, it can be used in `<int:priority-queue>` s to achieve _priority_ order polling for persisted messages.
The _priority_ MongoDB document field is populated from the `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.PRIORITY` (`priority`) message header.

In addition, all MongoDB `MessageStore` s now have a `sequence` field for MessageGroup documents.
The `sequence` value is the result of an `$inc` operation for a simple `sequence` document from the same collection, which is created on demand.
The `sequence` field is used in `poll` operations to provide first-in-first-out (FIFO) message order (within priority if configured) when messages are stored within the same millisecond.

NOTE: It is not recommended to use the same `MongoDbChannelMessageStore` bean for priority and non-priority, because the `priorityEnabled` option applies to the entire store.
However, the same `collection` can be used for both `MongoDbChannelMessageStore` types, because message polling from the store is sorted and uses indexes.
To configure that scenario, simply extend one message store bean from the other:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="channelStore" class="o.s.i.mongodb.store.MongoDbChannelMessageStore">
    <constructor-arg name="mongoDbFactory" ref="mongoDbFactory"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="queueChannel">
    <int:queue message-store="store"/>
</int:channel>

<bean id="priorityStore" parent="channelStore">
    <property name="priorityEnabled" value="true"/>
</bean>

<int:channel id="priorityChannel">
    <int:priority-queue message-store="priorityStore"/>
</int:channel>
----

[[mongodb-metadata-store]]
==== MongoDB Metadata Store

As of _Spring Integration 4.2_, a new MongoDB-based `MetadataStore` (<<metadata-store>>) implementation is available.
The `MongoDbMetadataStore` can be used to maintain metadata state across application restarts.
This new `MetadataStore` implementation can be used with adapters such as:

* <<twitter-inbound>>
* <<feed-inbound-channel-adapter>>
* <<file-reading>>
* <<ftp-inbound>>
* <<sftp-inbound>>

In order to instruct these adapters to use the new `MongoDbMetadataStore`, simply declare a Spring bean using the
bean name *metadataStore*. The _Twitter Inbound Channel Adapter_ and the _Feed Inbound Channel Adapter_ will both
automatically pick up and use the declared `MongoDbMetadataStore`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MetadataStore metadataStore(MongoDbFactory factory) {
    return new MongoDbMetadataStore(factory, "integrationMetadataStore");
}
----

The `MongoDbMetadataStore` also implements `ConcurrentMetadataStore`, allowing it to be reliably shared across multiple
application instances where only one instance will be allowed to store or modify a key's value.
All these operations are _atomic_ via MongoDB guarantees. For this purpose the `putIfAbsent` operation is implemented
as a _stored_ JavaScript function. Fom more information see
http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-mongo/docs/current/reference/html/#mongo.server-side-scripts[Script Operations]
and `MongoDbMetadataStore` JavaDocs.

[[mongodb-inbound-channel-adapter]]
=== MongoDB Inbound Channel Adapter

The _MongoDb Inbound Channel Adapter_ is a polling consumer that reads data from MongoDb and sends it as a Message payload.

[source,xml]
----
<int-mongodb:inbound-channel-adapter id="mongoInboundAdapter"
       channel="replyChannel"
       query="{'name' : 'Bob'}"
       entity-class="java.lang.Object"
       auto-startup="false">
		<int:poller fixed-rate="100"/>
</int-mongodb:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

As you can see from the configuration above, you configure a _MongoDb Inbound Channel Adapter_ using the `inbound-channel-adapter` element, providing values for various attributes such as:

* `query` or `query-expression` - a JSON query (see http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying[MongoDb Querying])
* `entity-class` - the type of the payload object; if not supplied, a `com.mongodb.DBObject` will be returned.
* `collection-name` or `collection-name-expression` - Identifies the name of the MongoDb collection to use.
* `mongodb-factory` - reference to an instance of `o.s.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory`
* `mongo-template` - reference to an instance of `o.s.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate`



 and other attributes that are common across all other inbound adapters (e.g., 'channel').

NOTE: You cannot set both `mongo-template` and `mongodb-factory`.

The example above is relatively simple and static since it has a literal value for the `query` and uses the default name for a `collection`.
Sometimes you may need to change those values at runtime, based on some condition.
To do that, simply use their `-expression` equivalents (`query-expression` and `collection-name-expression`) where the provided expression can be any valid SpEL expression.

Also, you may wish to do some post-processing to the successfully processed data that was read from the MongoDb.
For example; you may want to move or remove a document after its been processed.
You can do this using Transaction Synchronization feature that was added with Spring Integration 2.2.

[source,xml]
----
<int-mongodb:inbound-channel-adapter id="mongoInboundAdapter"
	   channel="replyChannel"
	   query="{'name' : 'Bob'}"
	   entity-class="java.lang.Object"
	   auto-startup="false">
				<int:poller fixed-rate="200" max-messages-per-poll="1">
				    <int:transactional synchronization-factory="syncFactory"/>
				</int:poller>
</int-mongodb:inbound-channel-adapter>

<int:transaction-synchronization-factory id="syncFactory">
	<int:after-commit expression="@documentCleaner.remove(#mongoTemplate, payload, headers.mongo_collectionName)" channe="someChannel"/>
</int:transaction-synchronization-factory>

<bean id="documentCleaner" class="foo.bar.DocumentCleaner"/>

<bean id="transactionManager" class="o.s.i.transaction.PseudoTransactionManager"/>
----

[source,java]
----
public class DocumentCleaner {
		public void remove(MongoOperations mongoOperations, Object target, String collectionName) {
			if (target instanceof List<?>){
				List<?> documents = (List<?>) target;
				for (Object document : documents) {
					mongoOperations.remove(new BasicQuery(JSON.serialize(document)), collectionName);
				}
			}
		}
}
----

As you can see from the above, all you need to do is declare your poller to be transactional with a `transactional` element.
This element can reference a real transaction manager (for example if some other part of your flow invokes JDBC).
If you don't have a 'real' transaction, you can use a `org.springframework.integration.transaction.PseudoTransactionManager` which is an implementation of Spring's `PlatformTransactionManager` and enables the use of the transaction synchronization features of the mongo adapter when there is no actual transaction.

IMPORTANT: This does NOT make MongoDB itself transactional, it simply allows the synchronization of actions to be taken before/after success (commit) or after failure (rollback).

Once your poller is transactional all you need to do is set an instance of the `o.s.i.transaction.TransactionSynchronizationFactory` on the `transactional` element.
`TransactionSynchronizationFactory` will create an instance of the `TransactioinSynchronization`.
For your convenience, we've exposed a default SpEL-based `TransactionSynchronizationFactory` which allows you to configure SpEL expressions, with their execution being coordinated (synchronized) with a transaction.
Expressions for before-commit, after-commit, and after-rollback are supported, together with a channel for each where the evaluation result (if any) will be sent.
For each sub-element you can specify `expression` and/or `channel` attributes.
If only the `channel` attribute is present the received Message will be sent there as part of the particular synchronization scenario.
If only the `expression` attribute is present and the result of an expression is a non-Null value, a Message with the result as the payload will be generated and sent to a default channel (NullChannel) and will appear in the logs (DEBUG).
If you want the evaluation result to go to a specific channel add a `channel` attribute.
If the result of an expression is null or void, no Message will be generated.

For more information about transaction synchronization, see <<transaction-synchronization>>.

[[mongodb-outbound-channel-adapter]]
=== MongoDB Outbound Channel Adapter

The _MongoDb Outbound Channel Adapter_ allows you to write the Message payload to a MongoDb document store

[source,xml]
----
<int-mongodb:outbound-channel-adapter id="fullConfigWithCollectionExpression"
	collection-name="myCollection"
	mongo-converter="mongoConverter"
	mongodb-factory="mongoDbFactory" />
----

As you can see from the configuration above, you configure a _MongoDb Outbound Channel Adapter_ using the `outbound-channel-adapter` element, providing values for various attributes such as:

* `collection-name` or `collection-name-expression` - Identifies the name of the MongoDb collection to use.
* `mongo-converter` - reference to an instance of `o.s.data.mongodb.core.convert.MongoConverter` to assist with converting a raw java object to a JSON document representation
* `mongodb-factory` - reference to an instance of `o.s.data.mongodb.MongoDbFactory`
* `mongo-template` - reference to an instance of `o.s.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate` (NOTE: you can not have both mongo-template and mongodb-factory set)



and other attributes that are common across all other inbound adapters (e.g., 'channel').

The example above is relatively simple and static since it has a literal value for the `collection-name`.
Sometimes you may need to change this value at runtime based on some condition.
To do that, simply use `collection-name-expression` where the provided expression can be any valid SpEL expression.

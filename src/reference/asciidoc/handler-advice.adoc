[[message-handler-advice-chain]]
=== Adding Behavior to Endpoints

Prior to Spring Integration 2.2, you could add behavior to an entire Integration flow by adding an AOP Advice to a poller's <advice-chain /> element.
However, let's say you want to retry, say, just a ReST Web Service call, and not any downstream endpoints.

For example, consider the following flow:

_inbound-adapter->poller->http-gateway1->http-gateway2->jdbc-outbound-adapter_

If you configure some retry-logic into an advice chain on the poller, and, the call to _http-gateway2_ failed because of a network glitch, the retry would cause both _http-gateway1_ and _http-gateway2_ to be called a second time.
Similarly, after a transient failure in the_jdbc-outbound-adapter_, both http-gateways would be called a second time before again calling the _jdbc-outbound-adapter_.

Spring Integration 2.2 adds the ability to add behavior to individual endpoints.
This is achieved by the addition of the <request-handler-advice-chain /> element to many endpoints.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<int-http:outbound-gateway id="withAdvice"
    url-expression="'http://localhost/test1'"
    request-channel="requests"
    reply-channel="nextChannel">
    <int:request-handler-advice-chain>
        <ref bean="myRetryAdvice" />
    </request-handler-advice-chain>
</int-http:outbound-gateway>
----

In this case, _myRetryAdvice_ will only be applied locally to this gateway and will not apply to further actions taken downstream after the reply is sent to the_nextChannel_.
The scope of the advice is limited to the endpoint itself.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
At this time, you cannot advise an entire <chain/> of endpoints.
The schema does not allow a <request-handler-advice-chain/> as a child element of the chain itself.

However, a <request-handler-advice-chain/> can be added to individual reply-producing endpoints _within_ a <chain/> element.
An exception is that, in a chain that produces no reply, because the last element in the chain is an_outbound-channel-adapter_, that _last_ element cannot be advised.
If you need to advise such an element, it must be moved outside of the chain (with the_output-channel_ of the chain being the _input-channel_ of the adapter.
The adapter can then be advised as normal.
For chains that produce a reply, every child element can be advised.
=====

[[advice-classes]]
==== Provided Advice Classes

In addition to providing the general mechanism to apply AOP Advice classes in this way, three standard Advices are provided:

* RequestHandlerRetryAdvice
* RequestHandlerCircuitBreakerAdvice
* ExpressionEvaluatingRequestHandlerAdvice



These are each described in detail in the following sections.

[[retry-advice]]
===== Retry Advice

The retry advice (`o.s.i.handler.advice.RequestHandlerRetryAdvice`) leverages the rich retry mechanisms provided by thehttps://github.com/SpringSource/spring-retry[Spring Retry] project.
The core component of `spring-retry` is the `RetryTemplate`, which allows configuration of sophisticated retry scenarios, including `RetryPolicy` and `BackoffPolicy` strategies, with a number of implementations, as well as a `RecoveryCallback` strategy to determine the action to take when retries are exhausted.

*Stateless Retry*

Stateless retry is the case where the retry activity is handled entirely within the advice, where the thread pauses (if so configured) and retries the action.

*Stateful Retry*

Stateful retry is the case where the retry state is managed within the advice, but where an exception is thrown and the caller resubmits the request.
An example for stateful retry is when we want the message originator (e.g.
JMS) to be responsible for resubmitting, rather than performing it on the current thread.
Stateful retry needs some mechanism to detect a retried submission.

*Further Information*

For more information on `spring-retry`, refer to the project's javadocs, as well as the reference documentation for http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/html/retry.html[Spring Batch], where `spring-retry` originated.

WARNING: The default back off behavior is no back off - retries are attempted immediately.
Using a back off policy that causes threads to pause between attempts may cause performance issues, including excessive memory use and thread starvation.
In high volume environments, back off policies should be used with caution.

[[retry-config]]
====== Configuring the Retry Advice

The following examples use a simple <service-activator />> that always throws an exception:
[source,java]
----
public class FailingService {

    public void service(String message) {
        throw new RuntimeException("foo");
    }
}
----

*Simple Stateless Retry*

This example uses the default `RetryTemplate` which has a `SimpleRetryPolicy` which tries 3 times.
There is no `BackOffPolicy` so the 3 attempts are made back-to-back-to-back with no delay between attempts.
There is no `RecoveryCallback` so, the result is to throw the exception to the caller after the final failed retry occurs.
In a _Spring Integration_ environment, this final exception might be handled using an `error-channel` on the inbound endpoint.

*Simple Stateless Retry with Recovery*

This example adds a `RecoveryCallback` to the above example; it uses a `ErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` to send an `ErrorMessage` to a channel.

----

*Stateless Retry with Customized Policies, and Recovery*

For more sophistication, we can provide the advice with a customized `RetryTemplate`.
This example continues to use the `SimpleRetryPolicy` but it increases the attempts to 4.
It also adds an `ExponentialBackoffPolicy` where the first retry waits 1 second, the second waits 5 seconds and the third waits 25 (for 4 attempts in all).

----

*Namespace Support for Stateless Retry*

Starting with _version 4.0_, the above configuration can be greatly simplified with the namespace support for the retry advice:

[source,xml]
----
<int:service-activator input-channel="input" ref="failer" method="service">
    <int:request-handler-advice-chain>
        <bean ref="retrier" />
    </request-handler-advice-chain>
</int:service-activator>

<int:handler-retry-advice id="retrier" max-attempts="4" recovery-channel="myErrorChannel">
	<int:exponential-back-off initial="1000" multiplier="5.0" maximum="60000" />
</int:handler-retry-advice>
----

In this example, the advice is defined as a top level bean so it can be used in multiple `request-handler-advice-chain` s.
You can also define the advice directly within the chain:

[source,xml]
----
<int:service-activator input-channel="input" ref="failer" method="service">
    <int:request-handler-advice-chain>
		<int:retry-advice id="retrier" max-attempts="4" recovery-channel="myErrorChannel">
			<int:exponential-back-off initial="1000" multiplier="5.0" maximum="60000" />
		</int:retry-advice>
    </request-handler-advice-chain>
</int:service-activator>
----

A `<handler-retry-advice/>` with no child element uses no back off; it can have a `fixed-back-off` or `exponential-back-off` child element.
If there is no `recovery-channel`, the exception is thrown when retries are exhausted.
The namespace can only be used with stateless retry.

For more complex environments (custom policies etc), use normal `<bean/>` definitions.

*Simple Stateful Retry with Recovery*

To make retry stateful, we need to provide the Advice with a RetryStateGenerator implementation.
This class is used to identify a message as being a resubmission so that the `RetryTemplate` can determine the current state of retry for this message.
The framework provides a `SpelExpressionRetryStateGenerator` which determines the message identifier using a SpEL expression.
This is shown below; this example again uses the default policies (3 attempts with no back off); of course, as with stateless retry, these policies can be customized.

[source,xml]
----
<int:service-activator input-channel="input" ref="failer" method="service">
    <int:request-handler-advice-chain>
        <bean class="o.s.i.handler.advice.RequestHandlerRetryAdvice">
            <property name="retryStateGenerator">
                <bean class="o.s.i.handler.advice.SpelExpressionRetryStateGenerator">
                    <constructor-arg value="headers['jms_messageId']" />
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="recoveryCallback">
                <bean class="o.s.i.handler.advice.ErrorMessageSendingRecoverer">
                    <constructor-arg ref="myErrorChannel" />
                </bean>
            </property>
        </bean>

----

Comparing with the stateless examples, you can see that with stateful retry, the exception is thrown to the caller on each failure.

*Exception Classification for Retry*

Spring Retry has a great deal of flexibility for determining which exceptions can invoke retry.
The default configuration will retry for all exceptions and the exception classifier just looks at the top level exception.
If you configure it to, say, only retry on `BarException` and your application throws a `FooException` where the cause is a `BarException`, retry will not occur.

Since _Spring Retry 1.0.3_, the `BinaryExceptionClassifier` has a property `traverseCauses` (default `false`).
When `true` it will traverse exception causes until it finds a match or there is no cause.

To use this classifier for retry, use a `SimpleRetryPolicy` created with the constructor that takes the max attempts, the `Map` of `Exception` s and the boolean (traverseCauses), and inject this policy into the `RetryTemplate`.

[[circuit-breaker-advice]]
===== Circuit Breaker Advice

The general idea of the Circuit Breaker Pattern is that, if a service is not currently available, then don't waste time (and resources) trying to use it.
The `o.s.i.handler.advice.RequestHandlerCircuitBreakerAdvice` implements this pattern.
When the circuit breaker is in the _closed_ state, the endpoint will attempt to invoke the service.
The circuit breaker goes to the _open_ state if a certain number of consecutive attempts fail; when it is in the _open_ state, new requests will "fail fast" and no attempt will be made to invoke the service until some time has expired.

When that time has expired, the circuit breaker is set to the _half-open_ state.
When in this state, if even a single attempt fails, the breaker will immediately go to the _open_ state; if the attempt succeeds, the breaker will go to the _closed_ state, in which case, it won't go to the _open_ state again until the configured number of consecutive failures again occur.
Any successful attempt resets the state to zero failures for the purpose of determining when the breaker might go to the _open_ state again.

Typically, this Advice might be used for external services, where it might take some time to fail (such as a timeout attempting to make a network connection).

The `RequestHandlerCircuitBreakerAdvice` has two properties: `threshold` and `halfOpenAfter`.
The _threshold_ property represents the number of consecutive failures that need to occur before the breaker goes _open_.
It defaults to 5.
The _halfOpenAfter_ property represents the time after the last failure that the breaker will wait before attempting another request.
Default is 1000 milliseconds.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<int:service-activator input-channel="input" ref="failer" method="service">
    <int:request-handler-advice-chain>
        <bean class="o.s.i.handler.advice.RequestHandlerCircuitBreakerAdvice">
            <property name="threshold" value="2" />
            <property name="halfOpenAfter" value="12000" />
        </bean>
    </int:request-handler-advice-chain>
</int:service-activator>

30.599 ERROR [task-scheduler-1]org.springframework.messaging.MessagingException: Circuit Breaker is Open for ServiceActivator
----

In the above example, the threshold is set to 2 and halfOpenAfter is set to 12 seconds; a new request arrives every 5 seconds.
You can see that the first two attempts invoked the service; the third and fourth failed with an exception indicating the circuit breaker is open.
The fifth request was attempted because the request was 15 seconds after the last failure; the sixth attempt fails immediately because the breaker immediately went to _open_.

[[expression-advice]]
===== Expression Evaluating Advice

The final supplied advice class is the `o.s.i.handler.advice.ExpressionEvaluatingRequestHandlerAdvice`.
This advice is more general than the other two advices.
It provides a mechanism to evaluate an expression on the original inbound message sent to the endpoint.
Separate expressions are available to be evaluated, either after success, or failure.
Optionally, a message containing the evaluation result, together with the input message, can be sent to a message channel.

A typical use case for this advice might be with an <ftp:outbound-channel-adapter />, perhaps to move the file to one directory if the transfer was successful, or to another directory if it fails:

The Advice has properties to set an expression when successful, an expression for failures, and corresponding channels for each.
For the successful case, the message sent to the_successChannel_ is an `AdviceMessage`, with the payload being the result of the expression evaluation, and an additional property `inputMessage` which contains the original message sent to the handler.
A message sent to the _failureChannel_ (when the handler throws an excecption) is an ErrorMessage with a payload of `MessageHandlingExpressionEvaluatingAdviceException`.
Like all `MessagingException` s, this payload has `failedMessage` and `cause` properties, as well as an additional property `evaluationResult`, containing the result of the expression evaluation.

When an exception is thrown in the scope of the advice, by default, that exception is thrown to caller after any
`failureExpression` is evaluated.
If you wish to suppress throwing the exception, set the `trapException` property to `true`.

[[custom-advice]]
==== Custom Advice Classes

In addition to the provided Advice classes above, you can implement your own Advice classes.
While you can provide any implementation of `org.aopalliance.aop.Advice`, it is generally recommended that you subclass `o.s.i.handler.advice.AbstractRequestHandlerAdvice`.
This has the benefit of avoiding writing low-level _Aspect Oriented Programming_ code as well as providing a starting point that is specifically tailored for use in this environment.

Subclasses need to implement the doInvoke() method:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Subclasses implement this method to apply behavior to the {@link MessageHandler} callback.execute()
 * invokes the handler method and returns its result, or null).
 * @param callback Subclasses invoke the execute() method on this interface to invoke the handler method.
 * @param target The target handler.
 * @param message The message that will be sent to the handler.
 * @return the result after invoking the {@link MessageHandler}.
 * @throws Exception
 */
protected abstract Object doInvoke(ExecutionCallback callback, Object target, Message<?> message) throws Exception;
----

The _callback_ parameter is simply a convenience to avoid subclasses dealing with AOP directly; invoking the `callback.execute()` method invokes the message handler.

The _target_ parameter is provided for those subclasses that need to maintain state for a specific handler, perhaps by maintaining that state in a `Map`, keyed by the target.
This allows the same advice to be applied to multiple handlers.
The `RequestHandlerCircuitBreakerAdvice` uses this to keep circuit breaker state for each handler.

The _message_ parameter is the message that will be sent to the handler.
While the advice cannot modify the message before invoking the handler, it can modify the payload (if it has mutable properties).
Typically, an advice would use the message for logging and/or to send a copy of the message somewhere before or after invoking the handler.

The return value would normally be the value returned by `callback.execute()`; but the advice does have the ability to modify the return value.
Note that only `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler` s return a value.

[source,java]
----
public class MyAdvice extends AbstractRequestHandlerAdvice {

    @Override
    protected Object doInvoke(ExecutionCallback callback, Object target, Message<?> message) throws Exception {
        // add code before the invocation
        Object result = callback.execute();
        // add code after the invocation
        return result;
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
=====
In addition to the `execute()` method, the `ExecutionCallback` provides an additional method `cloneAndExecute()`.
This method must be used in cases where the invocation might be called multiple times within a single execution of `doInvoke()`, such as in the `RequestHandlerRetryAdvice`.
This is required because the Spring AOP `org.springframework.aop.framework.ReflectiveMethodInvocation` object maintains state of which advice in a chain was last invoked; this state must be reset for each call.

For more information, see the http://static.springsource.org/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/ReflectiveMethodInvocation.html[ReflectiveMethodInvocation] JavaDocs.
=====

[[other-advice]]
==== Other Advice Chain Elements

While the abstract class mentioned above is provided as a convenience, you can add any `Advice` to the chain, including a transaction advice.

[[advising-filters]]
==== Advising Filters

There is an additional consideration when advising `Filter` s.
By default, any discard actions (when the filter returns false) are performed _within_ the scope of the advice chain.
This could include all the flow downstream of the _discard channel_.
So, for example if an element downstream of the _discard-channel_ throws an exception, and there is a retry advice, the process will be retried.
This is also the case if_throwExceptionOnRejection_ is set to true (the exception is thrown within the scope of the advice).

Setting _discard-within-advice_ to "false" modifies this behavior and the discard (or exception) occurs after the advice chain is called.

[[advising-with-annotations]]
==== Advising Endpoints Using Annotations

When configuring certain endpoints using annotations (`@Filter`, `@ServiceActivator`, `@Splitter`, and `@Transformer`), you can supply a bean name for the advice chain in the `adviceChain` attribute.
In addition, the `@Filter` annotation also has the `discardWithinAdvice` attribute, which can be used to configure the discard behavior as discussed in <<advising-filters>>.
An example with the discard being performed after the advice is shown below.

[source,java]
----
@MessageEndpoint
public class MyAdvisedFilter {

	@Filter(inputChannel="input", outputChannel="output",
			adviceChain="adviceChain", discardWithinAdvice="false")
	public boolean filter(String s) {
		return s.contains("good");
	}
}
----

[[advice-order]]
==== Ordering Advices within an Advice Chain

Advice classes are "around" advices and are applied in a nested fashion.
The first advice is the outermost, the last advice the innermost (closest to the handler being advised).
It is important to put the advice classes in the correct order to achieve the functionality you desire.

For example, let's say you want to add a retry advice and a transaction advice.
You may want to place the retry advice advice first, followed by the transaction advice.
Then, each retry will be performed in a new transaction.
On the other hand, if you want all the attempts, and any recovery operations (in the retry `RecoveryCallback`), to be scoped within the transaction, you would put the transaction advice first.

[[idempotent-receiver]]
==== Idempotent Receiver Enterprise Integration Pattern

Starting with _version 4.1_, Spring Integration provides an implementation of the http://www.eaipatterns.com/IdempotentReceiver.html[Idempotent Receiver] Enterprise Integration Pattern.
It is a _functional_ pattern and the whole _idempotency_ logic should be implemented in the application, however to simplify the decision-making, the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` component is provided.
This is an AOP `Advice`, which is applied to the `MessageHandler.handleMessage()` method and can `filter` a request message or mark it as a `duplicate`, according to its configuration.

Previously, users could have implemented this pattern, by using a custom MessageSelector in a `<filter/>` (<<filter>>), for example.
However, since this pattern is really behavior of an endpoint rather than being an endpoint itself, the Idempotent Receiver implementation doesn't provide an _endpoint_ component; rather, it is applied to endpoints declared in the application.

The logic of the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` is based on the provided `MessageSelector` and, if the message isn't accepted by that selector, it will be enriched with the `duplicateMessage` header set to `true`.
The target `MessageHandler` (or downstream flow) can consult this header to implement the correct _idempotency_ logic.
If the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` is configured with a `discardChannel` and/or `throwExceptionOnRejection = true`, the _duplicate_ Message won't be sent to the target `MessageHandler.handleMessage()`, but discarded.
If you simply want to discard (do nothing with) the _duplicate_ Message, the `discardChannel` should be configured with a `NullChannel`, such as the default `nullChannel` bean.

To maintain _state_ between messages and provide the ability to compare messages for the idempotency, the `MetadataStoreSelector` is provided.
It accepts a `MessageProcessor` implementation (which creates a lookup key based on the `Message`) and an optional `ConcurrentMetadataStore` (<<metadata-store>>).
See the `MetadataStoreSelector` JavaDocs for more information.
The `value` for `ConcurrentMetadataStore` also can be customized using additional `MessageProcessor`.
By default `MetadataStoreSelector` uses `timestamp` message header.

For convenience, the `MetadataStoreSelector` options are configurable directly on the `<idempotent-receiver>` component:

[source,xml]
----
<idempotent-receiver
		id=""  <1>
		endpoint=""  <2>
		selector=""  <3>
		discard-channel=""  <4>
		metadata-store=""  <5>

<1> The id of the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` bean.
_Optional_.



<2> Consumer Endpoint name(s) or pattern(s) to which this interceptor will be applied.
Separate names (patterns) with commas (`,`) e.g.
`endpoint="aaa, bbb*, *ccc, *ddd*, eee*fff"`.
Endpoint bean names matching these patterns are then used to retrieve the target endpoint's `MessageHandler` bean (using its `.handler` suffix), and the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` will be applied to those beans.
_Required_.



<3> A `MessageSelector` bean reference.
Mutually exclusive with `metadata-store` and `key-strategy (key-expression)`.
When `selector` is not provided, one of `key-strategy` or `key-strategy-expression` is required.



<4> Identifies the channel to which to send a message when the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` doesn't accept it.
When omitted, duplicate messages are forwarded to the handler with a `duplicateMessage` header.
_Optional_.



<5> A `ConcurrentMetadataStore` reference.
Used by the underlying `MetadataStoreSelector`.
Mutually exclusive with `selector`.
_Optional_.
The default `MetadataStoreSelector` uses an internal `SimpleMetadataStore` which does not maintain state across application executions.



<6> A `MessageProcessor` reference.
Used by the underlying `MetadataStoreSelector`.
Evaluates an `idempotentKey` from the request Message.
Mutually exclusive with `selector` and `key-expression`.
When a `selector` is not provided, one of `key-strategy` or `key-strategy-expression` is required.



<7> A SpEL expression to populate an `ExpressionEvaluatingMessageProcessor`.
Used by the underlying `MetadataStoreSelector`.
Evaluates an `idempotentKey` using the request Message as the evaluation context root object.
Mutually exclusive with `selector` and `key-strategy`.
When a `selector` is not provided, one of `key-strategy` or `key-strategy-expression` is required.



<8> A `MessageProcessor` reference.
Used by the underlying `MetadataStoreSelector`.
Evaluates a `value` for the `idempotentKey` from the request Message.
Mutually exclusive with `selector` and `value-expression`.
By default, the 'MetadataStoreSelector' uses the 'timestamp' message header as the Metadata 'value'.



<9> A SpEL expression to populate an `ExpressionEvaluatingMessageProcessor`.
Used by the underlying `MetadataStoreSelector`.
Evaluates a `value` for the `idempotentKey` using the request Message as the evaluation context root object.
Mutually exclusive with `selector` and `value-strategy`.
By default, the 'MetadataStoreSelector' uses the 'timestamp' message header as the Metadata 'value'.



<10> Throw an exception if the `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` rejects the message defaults to `false`.
It is applied regardless of whether or not a `discard-channel` is provided.


For Java configuration, the method level `IdempotentReceiver` annotation is provided.
It is used to mark a `method` that has a Messaging annotation (`@ServiceActivator`, `@Router` etc.) to specify which `IdempotentReceiverInterceptor` s will be applied to this endpoint:

@Bean
public IdempotentReceiverInterceptor idempotentReceiverInterceptor() {
   return new IdempotentReceiverInterceptor(new MetadataStoreSelector(m ->
                                                    m.getHeaders().get(INVOICE_NBR_HEADER)));
}

@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "input", outputChannel = "output")
@IdempotentReceiver("idempotentReceiverInterceptor")
public MessageHandler myService() {
    ....

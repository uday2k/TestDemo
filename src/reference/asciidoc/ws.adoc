== Web Services Support

[[webservices-outbound]]
=== Outbound Web Service Gateways

To invoke a Web Service upon sending a message to a channel, there are two options - both of which build upon the http://projects.spring.io/spring-ws/[Spring Web Services] project: `SimpleWebServiceOutboundGateway` and `MarshallingWebServiceOutboundGateway`.
The former will accept either a `String` or `javax.xml.transform.Source` as the message payload.
The latter provides support for any implementation of the `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` interfaces.
Both require a Spring Web Services `DestinationProvider` for determining the URI of the Web Service to be called.
[source,java]
----
 simpleGateway = new SimpleWebServiceOutboundGateway(destinationProvider);

 marshallingGateway = new MarshallingWebServiceOutboundGateway(destinationProvider, marshaller);

----

NOTE: When using the namespace support described below, you will only need to set a URI.
Internally, the parser will configure a fixed URI `DestinationProvider` implementation.
If you do need dynamic resolution of the URI at runtime, however, then the `DestinationProvider` can provide such behavior as looking up the URI from a registry.
See the Spring Web Services http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/api/org/springframework/ws/client/support/destination/DestinationProvider.html[DestinationProvider] JavaDoc for more information about this strategy.

For more detail on the inner workings, see the Spring Web Services reference guide's chapter covering http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/reference/html/client.html[client access] as well as the chapter covering http://static.springframework.org/spring-ws/site/reference/html/oxm.html[Object/XML mapping].

[[webservices-inbound]]
=== Inbound Web Service Gateways

To send a message to a channel upon receiving a Web Service invocation, there are two options again: `SimpleWebServiceInboundGateway` and `MarshallingWebServiceInboundGateway`.
The former will extract a `javax.xml.transform.Source` from the `WebServiceMessage` and set it as the message payload.
The latter provides support for implementation of the `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` interfaces.
If the incoming web service message is a SOAP message the SOAP Action header will be added to the headers of the`Message` that is forwarded onto the request channel.

[source,java]
----
 simpleGateway = new SimpleWebServiceInboundGateway();
 simpleGateway.setRequestChannel(forwardOntoThisChannel);
 simpleGateway.setReplyChannel(listenForResponseHere); //Optional

 marshallingGateway = new MarshallingWebServiceInboundGateway(marshaller);
 //set request and optionally reply channel

----

Both gateways implement the Spring Web Services `MessageEndpoint` interface, so they can be configured with a `MessageDispatcherServlet` as per standard Spring Web Services configuration.

For more detail on how to use these components, see the Spring Web Services reference guide's chapter covering http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/reference/html/server.html[creating a Web Service].
The chapter covering http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/oxm.html[Object/XML mapping] is also applicable again.

To include the `SimpleWebServiceInboundGateway` and `MarshallingWebServiceInboundGateway` configurations to the Spring WS
infrastructure you should add the `EndpointMapping` definition between `MessageDispatcherServlet` and the target
`MessageEndpoint` implementations like you do that with normal Spring WS application.
For this purpose (from Spring Integration perspective), the Spring WS provides these convenient `EndpointMapping`
implementations:

* `o.s.ws.server.endpoint.mapping.UriEndpointMapping`
* `o.s.ws.server.endpoint.mapping.PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping`
* `o.s.ws.soap.server.endpoint.mapping.SoapActionEndpointMapping`
* `o.s.ws.server.endpoint.mapping.XPathPayloadEndpointMapping`

The beans for these classes must be specified in the application context referencing to the
`SimpleWebServiceInboundGateway` and/or `MarshallingWebServiceInboundGateway` bean definitions according to the WS
mapping algorithm.

Please, refer to the http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/reference/html/server.html#server-endpoint-mapping[Endpoint mappings]
for the more information.

[[webservices-namespace]]
=== Web Service Namespace Support

To configure an outbound Web Service Gateway, use the "outbound-gateway" element from the "ws" namespace:
[source,xml]
----
<int-ws:outbound-gateway id="simpleGateway"
                     request-channel="inputChannel"
                     uri="http://example.org"/>
----

NOTE: Notice that this example does not provide a 'reply-channel'.
If the Web Service were to return a non-empty response, the Message containing that response would be sent to the reply channel provided in the request Message's REPLY_CHANNEL header, and if that were not available a channel resolution Exception would be thrown.
If you want to send the reply to another channel instead, then provide a 'reply-channel' attribute on the 'outbound-gateway' element.

TIP: When invoking a Web Service that returns an empty response after using a String payload for the request Message, _no reply Message will be sent by default_.
Therefore you don't need to set a 'reply-channel' or have a REPLY_CHANNEL header in the request Message.
If for any reason you actually _do_ want to receive the empty response as a Message, then provide the 'ignore-empty-responses' attribute with a value of _false_ (this only applies for Strings, because using a Source or Document object simply leads to a NULL response and will therefore_never_ generate a reply Message).

To set up an inbound Web Service Gateway, use the "inbound-gateway":
[source,xml]
----
<int-ws:inbound-gateway id="simpleGateway"
                    request-channel="inputChannel"/>
----

To use Spring OXM Marshallers and/or Unmarshallers, provide bean references.
For outbound:
[source,xml]
----
<int-ws:outbound-gateway id="marshallingGateway"
                     request-channel="requestChannel"
                     uri="http://example.org"
                     marshaller="someMarshaller"
                     unmarshaller="someUnmarshaller"/>
----

And for inbound:
[source,xml]
----
<int-ws:inbound-gateway id="marshallingGateway"
                    request-channel="requestChannel"
                    marshaller="someMarshaller"
                    unmarshaller="someUnmarshaller"/>
----

NOTE: Most `Marshaller` implementations also implement the `Unmarshaller` interface.
When using such a `Marshaller`, only the "marshaller" attribute is necessary.
Even when using a `Marshaller`, you may also provide a reference for the "request-callback" on the outbound gateways.

For either outbound gateway type, a "destination-provider" attribute can be specified instead of the "uri" (exactly one of them is required).
You can then reference any Spring Web Services DestinationProvider implementation (e.g.
to lookup the URI at runtime from a registry).

For either outbound gateway type, the "message-factory" attribute can also be configured with a reference to any Spring Web Services `WebServiceMessageFactory` implementation.

For the simple inbound gateway type, the "extract-payload" attribute can be set to false to forward the entire `WebServiceMessage` instead of just its payload as a `Message` to the request channel.
This might be useful, for example, when a custom Transformer works against the `WebServiceMessage` directly.

[[outbound-uri]]
=== Outbound URI Configuration

For all URI-schemes supported by Spring Web Services (http://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/docs/current/reference/html/client.html#client-transports[URIs and Transports]) `<uri-variable/>` substitution is provided:

[source,xml]
----
<ws:outbound-gateway id="gateway" request-channel="input"
        uri="http://springsource.org/{foo}-{bar}">
    <ws:uri-variable name="foo" expression="payload.substring(1,7)"/>
    <ws:uri-variable name="bar" expression="headers.x"/>
</ws:outbound-gateway>

<ws:outbound-gateway request-channel="inputJms"
        uri="jms:{destination}?deliveryMode={deliveryMode}&amp;priority={priority}"
        message-sender="jmsMessageSender">
    <ws:uri-variable name="destination" expression="headers.jmsQueue"/>
    <ws:uri-variable name="deliveryMode" expression="headers.deliveryMode"/>
    <ws:uri-variable name="priority" expression="headers.jms_priority"/>
</ws:outbound-gateway>
----

If a `DestinationProvider` is supplied, variable substitution is not supported and a configuration error will result if variables are provided.

_Controlling URI Encoding_

By default, the URL string is encoded (see http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriComponentsBuilder.html[UriComponentsBuilder]) to the URI object before sending the request.
In some scenarios with a non-standard URI it is undesirable to perform the encoding.
Since _version 4.1 _ the `<ws:outbound-gateway/>` provides an `encode-uri` attribute.
To disable encoding the URL, this attribute should be set to `false` (by default it is `true`).
If you wish to partially encode some of the URL, this can be achieved using an `expression` within a `<uri-variable/>`:
[source,xml]
----
<ws:outbound-gateway url="http://somehost/%2f/fooApps?bar={param}" encode-uri="false">
          <http:uri-variable name="param"
            expression="T(org.apache.commons.httpclient.util.URIUtil)
                                             .encodeWithinQuery('Hello World!')"/>
</ws:outbound-gateway>
----

Note, `encode-uri` is ignored, if `DestinationProvider` is supplied.

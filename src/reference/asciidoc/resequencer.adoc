=== Resequencer

==== Introduction

Related to the Aggregator, albeit different from a functional standpoint, is the Resequencer.

[[resequencer-functionality]]
==== Functionality

The Resequencer works in a similar way to the Aggregator, in the sense that it uses the CORRELATION_ID to store messages in groups, the difference being that the Resequencer does not process the messages in any way.
It simply releases them in the order of their SEQUENCE_NUMBER header values.

With respect to that, the user might opt to release all messages at once (after the whole sequence, according to the SEQUENCE_SIZE, has been released), or as soon as a valid sequence is available.

==== Configuring a Resequencer

Configuring a resequencer requires only including the appropriate element in XML.

A sample resequencer configuration is shown below.

<1> The id of the resequencer is _optional_.



<2> The input channel of the resequencer.
_Required_.



<3> The channel to which the resequencer will send the reordered messages.
_Optional_.



<4> The channel to which the resequencer will send the messages that timed out (if `send-partial-result-on-timeout` is _false)_.
_Optional_.



<5> Whether to send out ordered sequences as soon as they are available, or only after the whole message group arrives._Optional (false by default)_.



<6> A reference to a `MessageGroupStore` that can be used to store groups of messages under their correlation key until they are complete.
_Optional_ with default a volatile in-memory store.



<7> Whether, upon the expiration of the group, the ordered group should be sent out (even if some of the messages are missing)._Optional (false by default)_.
See <<reaper>>.



<8> The timeout interval to wait when sending a reply `Message` to the `output-channel` or `discard-channel`.
Defaults to `-1` - blocking indefinitely.
It is applied only if the output channel has some 'sending' limitations, e.g.
`QueueChannel` with a fixed 'capacity'.
In this case a `MessageDeliveryException` is thrown.
The `send-timeout` is ignored in case of `AbstractSubscribableChannel` implementations.
In case of `group-timeout(-expression)` the `MessageDeliveryException` from the scheduled expire task leads this task to be rescheduled.
_Optional_.



<9> A reference to a bean that implements the message correlation (grouping) algorithm.
The bean can be an implementation of the `CorrelationStrategy` interface or a POJO.
In the latter case the correlation-strategy-method attribute must be defined as well.
_Optional (by default, the aggregator will use
          the `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.CORRELATION_ID` header) _.



<10> A method defined on the bean referenced by `correlation-strategy`, that implements the correlation decision algorithm.
_Optional, with
          restrictions (requires `correlation-strategy` to be
          present)._



<11> A SpEL expression representing the correlation strategy.
Example: `"headers['foo']"`.
Only one of `correlation-strategy` or `correlation-strategy-expression` is allowed.



<12> A reference to a bean that implements the release strategy.
The bean can be an implementation of the `ReleaseStrategy` interface or a POJO.
In the latter case the release-strategy-method attribute must be defined as well.
_Optional (by default, the
          aggregator will use the `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.SEQUENCE_SIZE` header attribute)_.



<13> A method defined on the bean referenced by `release-strategy`, that implements the completion decision algorithm.
_Optional, with
          restrictions (requires `release-strategy` to be
          present)._



<14> A SpEL expression representing the release strategy; the root object for the expression is a `Collection` of `Message` s.
Example: `"size() == 5"`.
Only one of `release-strategy` or `release-strategy-expression` is allowed.



<15> Only applies if a `MessageGroupStoreReaper` is configured for the `<resequcencer>`'s `MessageStore`.
By default, when a `MessageGroupStoreReaper` is configured to expire partial groups, empty groups are also removed.
Empty groups exist after a group is released normally.
This is to enable the detection and discarding of late-arriving messages.
If you wish to expire empty groups on a longer schedule than expiring partial groups, set this property.
Empty groups will then not be removed from the `MessageStore` until they have not been modified for at least this number of milliseconds.
Note that the actual time to expire an empty group will also be affected by the reaper's _timeout_ property and it could be as much as this value plus the timeout.


<16> See <<aggregator-xml>>.



<17> See <<aggregator-xml>>.


<18> See <<aggregator-xml>>.


<19> See <<aggregator-xml>>.


<20> When a group is completed due to a timeout (or by a `MessageGroupStoreReaper`), the empty group's metadata is retained by default.
Late arriving messages will be immediately discarded.
Set this to `true` to remove the group completely; then, late arriving messages will start a new group and won't be discarded until the group again times out.
The new group will never be released normally because of the "hole" in the sequence range that caused the timeout.
Empty groups can be expired (completely removed) later using a `MessageGroupStoreReaper` together with the `empty-group-min-timeout` attribute.
Default: 'false'.

NOTE: Since there is no custom behavior to be implemented in Java classes for resequencers, there is no annotation support for it.

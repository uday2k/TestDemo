== Zookeeper Support

=== Introduction

https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Zookeeper] support was added to the framework in _version 4.2_, comprised of:

* MetadataStore
* LockRegistry
* Leadership Event Handling

[[zk-metadata-store]]
=== Zookeeper Metadata Store

The `ZookeeperMetadataStore` can be used where any `MetadataStore` is needed, such as peristent file list filters,
etc.
See <<metadata-store>> for more information.

[source, xml]
----
<bean id="client" class="org.springframework.integration.zookeeper.config.CuratorFrameworkFactoryBean">
    <constructor-arg value="${connect.string}" />
</bean>

<bean id="meta" class="org.springframework.integration.zookeeper.metadata.ZookeeperMetadataStore">
    <constructor-arg ref="client" />
</bean>
----

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public MetadataStore zkStore(CuratorFramework client) {
    return new ZookeeperMetadataStore(client);
}
----

[[zk-lock-registry]]
=== Zookeeper Lock Registry

The `ZookeeperLockRegistry` can be used where any `LockRegistry` is needed, such as when using an `Aggregator` in a
clustered environment, with a shared `MessageStore`.

A `LocRegistry` is used to "look up" a lock based on a key (the aggregator uses the `correlationId`).
By default, locks in the `ZookeeperLockRegistry` are maintained in zookeeper under the path
`/SpringIntegration-LockRegistry/`.
You can customize the path by providing an implementation of `ZookeeperLockRegistry.KeyToPathStrategy`.

[source, java]
----
public interface KeyToPathStrategy {

    String pathFor(String key);

    boolean bounded();

}
----

If the strategy returns `true` from `isBounded`, unused locks do not need to be harvested.
For unbounded strategies (such as the default) you will need to invoke `expireUnusedOlderThan(long age)` from time
to time, to remove old unused locks from memory.

[[zk-leadership]]
=== Zookeeper Leadership Event Handling

Groups of endpoints can be started/stopped based on leadership being granted or revoked respectively.
This is useful in clustered scenarios where shared resources must only be consumed by a single instance.
An example of this is a file inbound channel adapter that is polling a shared directory.
(See <<file-reading>>).

[source, xml]
----
<int-zk:leader-listener client="client" path="/siNamespace" role="cluster" />
----

`client` is a reference to a `CuratorFramework` bean; a `CuratorFrameworkFactoryBean` is available.
When a leader is elected, an `OnGrantedEvent` will be published for the role `cluster`; any endpoints in that role
will be started.
When leadership is revoked, an `OnRevokedEvent` will be published for the role `cluster`; any endpoints in that role
will be stopped.
See <<endpoint-roles>> for more information.

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean leaderInitiator(CuratorFramework client) {
    return new LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean(client, "/siTest/", "cluster");
}
